# Managing group permissions with Ansible Automation Platform Central Authentication

You can manage user access on the Ansible Automation Platform by grouping specific permissions into roles, and then assigning those roles to groups. As you log in to the Ansible Automation Platform for the first time, Users, Groups, and Roles appear in the user access page in automation hub, then you can assign user access and roles to each group.

Automation hub includes a set of managed roles that are compatible with use cases you may encounter. You can create your own set of managed roles or use the predefined roles located in the Roles section of the User Access page.

## Grouping permissions into Roles

You can group permissions into roles with specific user access to features in the system.

* You are signed in as a hubadmin user.

1. Log in to your private automation hub.
2. Navigate to the User Access drop-down menu.
3. Click btn:[Roles].
4. Click btn:[Add roles].
5. Enter role name in the Name field.
6. Enter role description in the Description field.
7. Click the drop-down menu next to each Permissions type and select the appropriate permissions for the role.
8. Click btn:[Save].

You have created a new role with specific permissions. You can now assign this role to groups.

### Assigning roles to groups

You can assign roles to groups, giving users access to specific features in the system, from both the Groups menu and the Namespaces menu. Roles assigned to a group from the Groups menu have a global scope. For example, if a user is assigned a namespace owner role, that permission applies to all namespaces. However, roles assigned to a group from the Namespaces menu will only give a user access to a specific instance of an object.

* You are signed in as a hubadmin user.
