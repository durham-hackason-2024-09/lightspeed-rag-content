# Assigning automation hub administrator permissions

Hub administrative users will need to be assigned the role of hubadmin in order to manage user permissions and groups. You can assign the role of hubadmin to a user through the Ansible Automation Platform Central Authentication client.

* A user storage provider (e.g., LDAP) has been added to your central authentication

1. Navigate to the ansible-automation-platform realm on your SSO client.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
3. Select a user from the list by clicking their ID.
4. Click the Role Mappings tab.
5. From the Client Roles list, select automation-hub.
6. Click btn:[hubadmin] from the Available Roles field, then click btn:[Add selected >].

The user is now a hubadmin. Repeat steps 3-6 to assign any additional users the hubadmin role.
