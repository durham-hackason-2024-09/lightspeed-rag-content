# Container supported topologies

The containerized installer deploys Ansible Automation Platform on Red Hat Enterprise Linux by using Podman which runs the platform in containers on host machines. Customers manage the product and infrastructure lifecycle.

# Container growth topology

The growth topology is intended for organizations that do not require Ansible Automation Platform to be deployed with redundancy or higher compute for large volumes of automation.

## Infrastructure topology

Each VM has been tested with the following component requirements: 16 GB RAM, 4 CPU, 60 GB local disk, and 3000 IOPS. Resources, such as storage, can be increased based on the needs of the deployment.



## Tested system configurations

Red Hat has tested the following configurations to install and run Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform:



## Network ports

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform uses several ports to communicate with its services. These ports must be open and available for incoming connections to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform server in order for it to work. Ensure that these ports are available and are not blocked by the server firewall.

## Storage requirements

* Execution environments are pulled into automation controller hybrid nodes and execution nodes that run jobs. The size of these containers influences the storage requirements for $PATH_WHERE_PODMAN_PUTS_CONTAINER_IMAGES.
* The primary determining factors for the size of the database and its storage volume, which defaults to $POSTGRES_DEFAULT_DATA_DIR, are:
* The quantity of job events (lines of output from automation controller jobs)
* The quantity of days of job data that are retained
* On execution nodes and automation controller control and hybrid nodes, job output is buffered to the disk in $NAME_OF_RECEPTOR_DIR_VAR, which defaults to /tmp.
* The size and quantity of collections synced to automation hub influence the storage requirements of $PATH_WHERE_PULP_STORES_COLLECTIONS.
