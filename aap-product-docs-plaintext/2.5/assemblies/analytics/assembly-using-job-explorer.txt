# About the Job Explorer

The Job Explorer provides a detailed view of jobs run on automation controller clusters across your organizations. You can access the Job Explorer by selecting menu:Automation Analytics[Job Explorer] from the navigation panel or using the drill-down view available across each of the application's charts.
Using the Job Explorer you can:
* Filter the types of jobs running in a cluster or organization;
* Directly link out to templates on automation controller for further assessment;
* Identify and review job failures;
* View more details for top templates running on a cluster;
* Filter out nested workflows and jobs.
You can review the features and details of the Job Explorer in the following sections.

# Creating a filtered and sorted view of jobs

You can view a list of jobs, filtered by attributes you choose, using the Job Explorer.

Filter options include:

* Status
* Job
* Cluster
* Organization
* Inventory
* Template

You can sort results by any of the parameters from each column using the directional arrows.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Analytics[Job Explorer].
2. In the filter toolbar, select Job from the Filter by list.
3. In that same toolbar, select a time range. Job Explorer will now display jobs within that time range.
4. To further refine results, return to the filter toolbar and select a different attribute to filter results by, including job status, cluster, or organization.

The Job Explorer view updates and presents a list of jobs based on the attributes you selected.

## Viewing more information about an individual job

You can click on the arrow icon next to the job Id/Name column to view more details related to that job.

## Reviewing job details on automation controller

Click the job in the Id/Name column to view the job itself on the automation controller job details page. For more information on viewing job details on automation controller, see Jobs in the Automation Controller User Guide.

# Drilling down into cluster  data

You can drill down into cluster data to review more detailed information about successful or failed jobs. The detailed view, presented on the Job Explorer page, provides information on the cluster, organization, template, and job type. Filters you select on the Clusters view carry over to the Job Explorer page.

Details on those job templates will appear in the Job Explorer view, modified by any filters you select in the Clusters view.

For example, you can drill down to review details for failed jobs in a cluster. See below to learn more.

## Example: Reviewing failed jobs

You can view more detail about failed jobs across your organization by drilling down on the graph on the Cluster view and using the Job Explorer to refine results. Clicking on a specific portion in a graph will open that information in the Job Explorer, preserving contextual information created when using filters on the Clusters view.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Analytics[Clusters].
2. Using the filter lists in the toolbar, you can apply filters for clusters and time range of your choosing.
3. Click on a segment on the graph.

You are redirected to the Job Explorer view, and presented with a list of successful and failed jobs corresponding to that day on the bar graph.

To view only failed jobs:

1. Select Status from the Filter by list.
2. Select the Failed filter.

The view is updated to show only failed jobs run on that day.

Add additional context to the view by applying additional filters and selecting attributes to sort results. Link out and review more information for failed jobs on the automation controller job details page.

# Viewing top templates job details for a specific cluster

You can view job instances for top templates in a cluster to learn more about individual job runs associated with that template or to apply filters to further drill down into the data.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Analytics[Clusters].
2. Click on a template name in Top Templates.
3. Click btn:[View all jobs] in the modal that appears.

The Job Explorer page displays all jobs on the chosen cluster associated with that template. The view presented will preserve the contextual information of the template based on the parameters selected in the Clusters view.

# Ignoring nested workflows and jobs

Select the settings icon on the Job Explorer view and use the toggle switch to Ignore nested workflows and jobs. This option filters out duplicate workflow and job template entries and excludes those items from overall totals.


[NOTE]
----
About nested workflows
Nested workflows allow you to create workflow job templates that call other workflow job templates. Nested workflows promotes reuse, as modular components, of workflows that include existing business logic and organizational requirements in automating complex processes and operations.
To learn more about nested workflows, see Workflows in the Automation Controller User Guide.
