# Viewing your reports on Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

The reports feature on the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides users with a visual overview of their automation efforts across different teams using Ansible. Each report is designed to help users monitor the status of their automation environment, be it the frequency of playbook runs or the status of hosts affected by various job templates.
For example, you can use your reports to:
* View the number of hosts affected by a job template
* View the number changes made to hosts by a job template
* View the frequency of a job template run, and the rate of job templates that succeed or fail to run

# Reviewing your reports

To view reports about your Ansible automation environment, proceed with the following steps:

1. Log in to console.redhat.com and navigate to the Ansible Automation Platform.
2. Click btn:[Reports] on the side navigation panel.
3. Select a report from the results to view it.

Each report presents data to monitor your Ansible automation environment. Use the filter toolbar on each report to adjust your graph view.
