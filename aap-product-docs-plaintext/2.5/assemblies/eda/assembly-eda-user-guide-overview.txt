# Event-Driven Ansible controller overview

Event-Driven Ansible is a highly scalable, flexible automation capability that works with event sources such as other software vendors' monitoring tools.
These tools monitor IT solutions and identify events and automatically implement the documented changes or response in a rulebook to handle that event.

The following procedures form the user configuration:

* Setting up credentials
* Setting up a new project
* Setting up a new decision environment
* Setting up a rulebook activation
* Performance tuning for EDAcontroller


[NOTE]
----
* API documentation for Event-Driven Ansible controller is available at https://<eda-server-host>/api/eda/v1/docs
* To meet high availability demands, Event-Driven Ansible controller shares centralized Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) with the Ansible Automation Platform UI. When Redis is unavailable, you will not be able to create projects or enable rulebook activations.
