# Installation of Event-Driven Ansible controller

Similar to the automation controller and automation hub components, the setup for Event-Driven Ansible controller includes default settings for specific variables in the inventory files.

[IMPORTANT]
----
Event-Driven Ansible controller must be installed on a separate server and cannot be installed on the same host as automation hub and automation controller.
----

[NOTE]
----
If you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and want to set your memory limits, you must have cgroup v2 enabled before you install Event-Driven Ansible. For specific instructions, see the Knowledge-Centered Support (KCS) article, Ansible Automation Platform Event-Driven Ansible controller for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 requires cgroupv2.

# Installing Event-Driven Ansible controller on Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

To prepare for installation of Event-Driven Ansible controller, review the following information in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Planning Guide:

* Example Ansible Automation Platform architecture, including the Event-Driven Ansible controller
* Event-Driven Ansible controller general information
* Event-Driven Ansible controller system requirements

When you are ready to install the Event-Driven Ansible controller, see the procedures in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide beginning with Chapter 3. Installing Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

Lastly, see Appendix A. 5. Event-Driven Ansible controller variables in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide to view predefined variables for Event-Driven Ansible controller.

# Deploying Event-Driven Ansible controller with Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform

Event-Driven Ansible is not limited to Ansible Automation Platform on VMs. You can also access this feature on Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform. To deploy Event-Driven Ansible with Ansible Automation Platform Operator, follow the instructions in Deploying Event-Driven Ansible controller with Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform.

After successful deployment, you can connect to event sources and resolve issues more efficiently.
