# Rule Audit

Rule audit allows the auditing of rules which have been triggered by all the rules that were activated at some point.
The Rule Audit list view shows you a list of every time an event came in that matched a condition within a rulebook and triggered an action.
The list shows you rules within your rulebook and each heading matches up to a rule that has been executed.
