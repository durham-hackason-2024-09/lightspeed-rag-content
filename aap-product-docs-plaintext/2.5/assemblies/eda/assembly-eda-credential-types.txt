# Credential types

Event-Driven Ansible controller comes with several built-in credental types that you can use for syncing projects, running rulebook activations, executing job templates through Automation Execution (automation controller), fetching images from container registries, and processing data through event streams.
These built-in credential types are not editable. So if you want credential types that support authentication with other systems, you can create your own credential types that can be used in your source plugins. Each credential type contains an input configuration and an injector configuration that can be passed to an Ansible rulebook to configure your sources.
For more information, see Custom credential types.

# Custom credential types

As a system administrator, you can define a custom credential type that works in ways similar to existing credential types in a standard format using a YAML or JSON-like definition.

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration field and the Injector Configuration field, if applicable. Custom credentials support Ansible extra variables as a means of injecting their authentication information.

You can attach one or more cloud, vault, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credentials to a rulebook activation.


[NOTE]
----
* When creating a new credential type, you must avoid collisions in the extra_vars.
* Extra variable names must not start with EDA_ because they are reserved.
* You must have System administrator (superuser) permissions to be able to create and edit a credential type and to be able to view the Injector configuration field.
----

When you customize your own credential types, they will display on the Credential Types page along with a list of built-in credential types.

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration and the Injector Configuration fields, if applicable. Both YAML and JSON formats are supported in the configuration fields.

## Input Configuration

The Input configuration has two attributes:

* fields - a collection of properties for a credential type.
* required - a list of required fields.

Fields can have multiple properties, depending on the credential type you select.



## Injector Configuration

You can use the Injector configuration field to take the fields from input configuration field and map them into extra_vars that can be sent to ansible-rulebook when running the activation. The Injector currently only supports extra_vars.

Injectors enable you to tailor the fields so that they can be injected into a rulebook as extra_vars, which cannot have duplicate keys at the top level. If you have two sources in a rulebook that both require a parameter called username and password, the injectors, along with the rulebook, help you tailor the arguments for each source.

# Creating a new credential type

You can create a credential type to use with a source plugin that you select based on the supported, default credential types. You can make your credential type available to a team or individuals.

1. Log in to the Ansible Automation Platform Dashboard.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Decisions[Infrastructure > Credential Types].
3. Click btn:[Create credential type].
4. Insert the following:
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
5. In the Input Configuration field, specify an input schema that defines a set of ordered fields for that type. The format can be in YAML or JSON:

YAML

fields:
  - type: string
    id: username
    label: Username
  - type: string
    id: password
    label: Password
    secret: true
required:
  - username
  - password

View more YAML examples at the YAML page.

JSON

{
"fields": [
  {
  "type": "string",
  "id": "username",
  "label": "Username"
  },
  {
  "secret": true,
  "type": "string",
  "id": "password",
  "label": "Password"
   }
  ],
 "required": ["username", "password"]
}

View more JSON examples at The JSON website.
6. In the Injector Configuration field, enter environment variables or extra variables that specify the values a credential type can inject.
The format can be in YAML or JSON (see examples in the previous step).

The following configuration in JSON format shows each field and how they are used:

{
    "extra_vars": {
      "some_extra_var": "{{ username }}:{{ password }}"
  }
}
7. Click btn:[Create credential type].

Your newly created credential type is displayed in the list of credential types:


8. Click the btn:[Edit credential type]  icon to modify the credential type options.

[NOTE]
----
On the Edit page, you can modify the details or delete the credential.
If the Delete option is disabled, this means that the credential type is being used by a credential, and you must delete the credential type from all the credentials that use it before you can delete it.
----

* Verify that the newly created credential type can be selected from the Credential Type selection window when creating a new credential:
