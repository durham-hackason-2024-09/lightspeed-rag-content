# Decision environments

Decision environments are a container image to run Ansible rulebooks.
They create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and provide a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.
The default decision environment is found in the Ansible-Rulebook.
To create your own decision environment refer to Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform.

# Setting up a new decision environment

The following steps describe how to import a decision environment into your Event-Driven Ansible controller Dashboard.

* You are logged in to the Event-Driven Ansible controller Dashboard as a Content Consumer.
* You have set up a credential, if necessary.
For more information, see the Setting up credentials section.
* You have pushed a decision environment image to an image repository or you chose to use the image de-supported provided at registry.redhat.io.

1. Log in to the Ansible Automation Platform Dashboard.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Decisions[Decision Environments].
3. Click btn:[Create decision environment].
4. Insert the following:
Name:: Insert the name.
Description:: This field is optional.
Image:: This is the full image location, including the container registry, image name, and version tag.
Credential:: This field is optional. This is the token needed to utilize the decision environment image.
5. Select btn:[Create decision environment].

Your decision environment is now created and can be managed on the Decision Environments page.

After saving the new decision environment, the decision environment&#8217;s details page is displayed.
From there or the Decision Environments list view, you can edit or delete it.

# Building a custom decision environment for Event-Driven Ansible within Ansible Automation Platform

Use the following instructions if you need a custom decision environment to provide a custom maintained or third-party event source plugin that is not available in the default decision environment.

* Ansible Automation Platform > = 2.4
* Event-Driven Ansible
* Ansible Builder > = 3.0

* Add the de-supported decision environment. This image is built from a base image provided by Red Hat called de-minimal.

[NOTE]
----
Red Hat recommends using de-minimal as the base image with Ansible Builder to build your custom decision environments.
----

The following is an example of the Ansible Builder definition file that uses de-minimal as a base image to build a custom decision environment with the ansible.eda collection:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```


Additionally, if you need other Python packages or RPMs, you can add the following to a single definition file:


```
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: 'registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-24/de-minimal-rhel8:latest'

dependencies:
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - ansible.eda
  python:
    - six
    - psutil
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  python_interpreter:
    package_system: "python39"

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf
```
