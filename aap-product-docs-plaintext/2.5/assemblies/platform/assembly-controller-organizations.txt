# Organizations

An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, and resources. It is the highest level object in the Ansible Automation Platform object hierarchy. After you have created an organization, Ansible Automation Platform displays the organization details. You can then manage access and execution environments for the organization.
Ansible Automation Platform automatically creates a default organization and the system administrator is automatically assigned to this organization. If you have a Self-support level license, you have only the default organization available and must not delete it.

[NOTE]

Only Enterprise or Premium licenses can add new organizations.
