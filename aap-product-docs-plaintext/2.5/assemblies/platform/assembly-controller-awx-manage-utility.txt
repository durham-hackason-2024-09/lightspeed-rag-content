# The awx-manage Utility

Use the awx-manage utility to access detailed internal information of automation controller.
Commands for awx-manage must run as the awx user only.

# Inventory Import

awx-manage is a mechanism by which an automation controller administrator can import inventory directly into automation controller.

To use awx-manage properly, you must first create an inventory in automation controller to use as the destination for the import.

For help with awx-manage, run the following command:

awx-manage inventory_import [--help]

The inventory_import command synchronizes an automation controller inventory object with a text-based inventory file, dynamic inventory script, or a directory of one or more, as supported by core Ansible.

When running this command, specify either an --inventory-id or --inventory-name, and the path to the Ansible inventory source (--source).

awx-manage inventory_import --source=/ansible/inventory/ --inventory-id=1

By default, inventory data already stored in automation controller blends with data from the external source.

To use only the external data, specify --overwrite.

To specify that any existing hosts get variable data exclusively from the --source, specify --overwrite_vars.

The default behavior adds any new variables from the external source, overwriting keys that already exist, but preserving any variables that were not sourced from the external data source.

awx-manage inventory_import --source=/ansible/inventory/ --inventory-id=1 --overwrite


[NOTE]
----
Edits and additions to Inventory host variables persist beyond an inventory synchronization as long as --overwrite_vars is not set.

# Cleanup of old data

awx-manage has a variety of commands used to clean old data from automation controller.
Automation controller administrators can use the automation controller Management Jobs interface for access or use the command line.

awx-manage cleanup_jobs [--help]

This permanently deletes the job details and job output for jobs older than a specified number of days.

awx-manage cleanup_activitystream [--help]

This permanently deletes any [Activity stream] data older than a specific number of days.

# Cluster management

For more information about the awx-manage provision_instance and awx-manage deprovision_instance commands, see Clustering.


[NOTE]
----
Do not run other awx-manage commands unless instructed by Ansible Support.

# Analytics gathering

Use this command to gather analytics on-demand outside of the predefined window (the default is 4 hours):

$ awx-manage gather_analytics --ship

For customers with disconnected environments who want to collect usage information about unique hosts automated across a time period, use this
command:

awx-manage host_metric --since YYYY-MM-DD --until YYYY-MM-DD --json

The parameters --since and --until specify date ranges and are optional, but one of them has to be present.

The --json flag specifies the output format and is optional.
