# Configuring the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

The platform gateway for Ansible Automation Platform enables you to manage the following Ansible Automation Platform components to form a single user interface:
* Automation controller
* Automation hub
* Event-Driven Ansible
* Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed (This feature is disabled by default, you must opt in to use it.)
Before you can deploy the platform gateway you must have Ansible Automation Platform Operator installed in a namespace.
If you have not installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator see .

[NOTE]
----
Platform gateway is only available under Ansible Automation Platform Operator version 2.5. Every component deployed under Ansible Automation Platform Operator 2.5 will also default to version 2.5.
----
If you have the Ansible Automation Platform Operator and some or all of the Ansible Automation Platform components installed see  for how to proceed.

# Linking your components to the platform gateway

After installing the Ansible Automation Platform Operator in your namespace you can set up your Ansible Automation Platform instance.
Then link all the platform components to a single user interface.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select the Details tab.
5. On the Ansible Automation Platform tile click btn:[Create instance].
6. From the Create Ansible Automation Platform page enter a name for your instance in the Name field.
7. Click btn:[YAML view] and paste the following:

```
spec:
  controller:
    disabled: false

  eda:
    disabled: false

  hub:
    disabled: false
    storage_type: file
    file_storage_storage_class: nfs-local-rwx
    file_storage_size: 10Gi
```

8. Click btn:[Create].

Go to your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment and click btn:[All instances] to verify if all instances deployed correctly.
You should see the Ansible Automation Platform instance and the deployed AutomationController, EDA, and AutomationHub instances here.

Alternatively you can check by the command line, run: oc get route

# Accessing the platform gateway

You should use the Ansible Automation Platform instance as your default.
This instance links the automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible deployments to a single interface.

To access your Ansible Automation Platform instance:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Networking[Routes]
3. Click the link under Location for Ansible Automation Platform.
4. This redirects you to the Ansible Automation Platform login page. Enter "admin" as your username in the Username field.
5. For the password you need to:
1. Go to to menu:Workloads[Secrets].
2. Click btn:[<your instance name>-admin-password] and copy the password.
3. Paste the password into the Password field.
6. Click btn:[Login].
7. Apply your subscription:
1. Click btn:[Subscription manifest] or btn:[Username/password].
2. Upload your manifest or enter your username and password.
3. Select  your subscription from the Subscription list.
4. Click btn:[Next].
This redirects you to the Analytics page.
8. Click btn:[Next].
9. Select the I agree to the terms of the license agreement checkbox.
10. Click btn:[Next].

You now have access to the platform gateway user interface.
If you cannot access the Ansible Automation Platform see  for help with troubleshooting and debugging.

# Deploying the platform gateway with existing Ansible Automation Platform components

You can link any components of the Ansible Automation Platform, that you have already installed to a new Ansible Automation Platform instance.

The following procedure simulates a scenario where you have automation controller as an existing component and want to add automation hub and Event-Driven Ansible.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Click btn:[Subscriptions] and edit your Update channel to stable-2.5.
5. Click btn:[Details] and on the Ansible Automation Platform tile click btn:[Create instance].
6. From the Create Ansible Automation Platform page enter a name for your instance in the Name field.
7. Click btn:[YAML view] and copy in the following:

```
    apiVersion: aap.ansible.com/v1alpha1
        kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatform
        metadata:
          name: example-aap
          namespace: aap
        spec:
          # Platform
          image_pull_policy: IfNotPresent
          # Components
          controller:
            disabled: false
            name: existing-controller-name
          eda:
            disabled: false
          hub:
            disabled: false
            ## uncomment if using file storage for Content pod
            storage_type: file
            file_storage_storage_class: your-rwx-storage-class
            file_storage_size: 10Gi

            ## uncomment if using S3 storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: S3
            # object_storage_s3_secret: example-galaxy-object-storage

            ## uncomment if using Azure storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: azure
            # object_storage_azure_secret: azure-secret-name
          lightspeed:
            disabled: true
```

1. For new components, if you do not specify a name, a default name is generated.
8. Click btn:[Create].
9. To access your new instance, see .


[NOTE]
----
If you have an existing controller with a managed Postgres pod, after creating the Ansible Automation Platform resource your automation controller instance will continue to use that original Postgres pod. If you were to do a fresh install you would have a single Postgres managed pod for all instances.

# Frequently asked questions on platform gateway

If I delete my Ansible Automation Platform deployment will I still have access to Automation Controller?:: No, automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible are nested within the deployment and are also deleted.
Something went wrong with my deployment but I'm not sure what, how can I find out?:: You can follow along in the command line while the operator is reconciling, this can be helpful for debugging.
Alternatively you can click into the deployment instance to see the status conditions being updated as the deployment goes on.
Is it still possible to view individual component logs?:: When troubleshooting you should examine the Ansible Automation Platform instance for the main logs and then each individual component (EDA, AutomationHub, AutomationController) for more specific information.
Where can I view the condition of an instance?:: To display status conditions click into the instance, and look under the Details or Events tab.
Alternatively, to display the status conditions you can run the get command:
oc get automationcontroller <instance-name> -o jsonpath=Pipe "| jq"
Can I track my migration in real time?:: To help track the status of the migration or to understand why migration might have failed you can look at the migration logs as they are running. Use the logs command:
oc logs fresh-install-controller-migration-4.6.0-jwfm6 -f
