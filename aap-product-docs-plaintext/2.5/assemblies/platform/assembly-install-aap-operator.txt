# Installing the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

* You have installed the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform catalog in OperatorHub.
* You have created a StorageClass object for your platform and a persistent volume claim (PVC) with ReadWriteMany access mode. See Dynamic provisioning for details.
* To run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with ReadWriteMany access mode, you must add NFS or other storage.
* For information about the AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) or to use the aws-ebs storage class, see Persistent storage using AWS Elastic Block Store.
* To use multi-attach ReadWriteMany access mode for AWS EBS, see Attaching a volume to multiple instances with Amazon EBS Multi-Attach.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[OperatorHub].
3. Search for Ansible Automation Platform and click btn:[Install].
4. Select an Update Channel:
* stable-2.x: installs a namespace-scoped operator, which limits deployments of automation hub and automation controller instances to the namespace the operator is installed in. This is suitable for most cases. The stable-2.x channel does not require administrator privileges and utilizes fewer resources because it only monitors a single namespace.
* stable-2.x-cluster-scoped: deploys automation hub and automation controller across multiple namespaces in the cluster and requires administrator privileges for all namespaces in the cluster.
5. Select Installation Mode, Installed Namespace, and Approval Strategy.
6. Click btn:[Install].

The installation process will begin. When installation is complete, a modal will appear notifying you that the Ansible Automation Platform Operator is installed in the specified namespace.

* Click btn:[View Operator] to view your newly installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator.
