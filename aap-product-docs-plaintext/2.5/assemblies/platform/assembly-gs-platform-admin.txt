# Configure authentication

After your first login as an administrator you must configure authentication for your users.
Depending on your organization&#8217;s needs and resources, you can either:

* Set up Basic authentication by creating users, teams, and organizations manually.
* Use an external source such as GitHub to configure authentication for your system.

# Managing user access with role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts user access based on their role within an organization.
The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have to the network.

You can control what users can do with the components of Ansible Automation Platform at a broad or granular level depending on your RBAC policy.
You can select whether the user is a system administrator or normal user and align roles and access permissions with their positions within the organization.

You can define roles with many permissions that can then be assigned to resources, teams, and users.
The permissions that make up a role dictate what the assigned role allows.
Permissions are allocated with only the access needed for a user to perform the tasks appropriate for their role.

# Creating an organization

Ansible Automation Platform automatically creates a default organization. If you have a self-support level license, you have only the default organization available and can not delete it.
You can use the default organization as it is initially set up and edit it later.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Organizations].
2. Click btn:[Create organization].
3. Enter the Name and optionally provide a Description for your organization.

[NOTE]
----
If automation controller is enabled on the platform, continue with Step 4. Otherwise, proceed to Step 7.
----
4. Enter the name of the Instance Groups on which to run this organization.
5. Select the name of the Default execution environment or search for one that exists on which to run this organization.
6. Optional: Enter the Galaxy credentials or search from a list of existing ones.
7. Click btn:[Next].
8. You can manage the instance group order by dragging and dropping the instance group up or down in the list.

[NOTE]
----
The execution precedence is determined by the order in which the instance groups are listed.
----
9. Click btn:[Next] and verify the organization settings.
10. Click btn:[Finish].

# Creating a team

You can create new teams, assign an organization to the team, and manage the users and administrators associated with each team.
Users associated with a team inherit the permissions associated with the team and any organization permissions to which the team has membership.
To add a user or administrator to a team, the user must have already been created.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Teams].
2. Click btn:[Create team].
3. Enter a Name and optionally give a Description for the team.
4. Select an Organization to be associated with this team.

[NOTE]
----
Each team can only be assigned to one organization.
----
5. Click btn:[Create team].

The Details page opens, where you can review and edit your team information.

# Creating a user

You can assign two types of users:

Normal user:: Normal users have read and write access limited to the resources (such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.
System administrator:: A System administrator (also known as a Superuser) has full system administration privileges — with full read and write privileges over the entire installation. A System administrator is typically responsible for managing all aspects of and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day work to various users.
Select the Organization to be assigned for this user.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. Click btn:[Create user].
3. Enter the details about your new user in the fields on the Create user page.
Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.

[NOTE]
----
If you are modifying your own password, log out and log back in again for it to take effect.
----
4. Click btn:[Create user].

When the user is successfully created, the User dialog opens.
From here, you can review and change the user&#8217;s Teams, Roles, Tokens and other membership details.

[NOTE]
----
If the user is not newly-created, the details screen displays the last login activity of that user.
----

If you log in as yourself, and view the details of your user profile, you can manage tokens from your user profile by selecting the Tokens tab.

# Configuring GitHub authentication

You can connect GitHub identities to Ansible Automation Platform using OAuth.
To set up GitHub authentication, you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from GitHub using the Installing your own GitHub App.

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.
To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration.
For more information about accessing this, see Displaying authenticator details.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Authentication Methods].
2. Click btn:[Create authentication].
3. Select GitHub from the Authentication type list.
4. Enter a Name for this authentication setting.
5. When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret:
* Copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the GitHub OAuth2 Key field.
* Copy and paste the GitHub Client Secret into the GitHub OAuth2 Secret field.
6. Optional: Enter any Additional Authenticator Fields that this authenticator can take.
These fields are not validated and are passed directly back to the authenticator.

[NOTE]
----
Values defined in this field override the dedicated fields provided in the UI.
----
7. To automatically create organizations, users and teams upon successful login, select Create objects.
8. To enable this authentication method upon creation, select Enabled.
9. To remove a user for any groups they were previously added to when they authenticate from this source, select Remove users.
10. Click btn:[Next].
