# Deploying Event-Driven Ansible controller with Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform

Event-Driven Ansible controller is the interface for event-driven automation and introduces automated resolution of IT requests. This component helps you connect to sources of events and acts on those events using rulebooks. When you deploy Event-Driven Ansible controller, you can automate decision making, use numerous event sources, implement event-driven automation within and across multiple IT use cases, and achieve more efficient service delivery.

Use the following instructions to install Event-Driven Ansible with your Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform.

* You have installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform.
* You have installed and configured automation controller.

1. Select menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
2. Locate and select your installation of Ansible Automation Platform.
3. Under the Details tab, locate the EDA modal and click Create instance.
4. Click btn:[Form view], and in the Name field, enter the name you want for your new Event-Driven Ansible controller deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
----
If you have installed other Ansible Automation Platform components in your current OpenShift Container Platform namespace, ensure that you provide a unique name for your Event-Driven Ansible controller when you create your Event-Driven Ansible custom resource. Otherwise, naming conflicts can occur and impact Event-Driven Ansible controller deployment.
----
5. Specify your controller URL in the Automation Server URL field.

If you deployed automation controller in Openshift as well, you can find the URL in the navigation panel under menu:Networking[Routes].

[NOTE]
----
This is the only required customization, but you can customize other options using the UI form or directly in the YAML configuration tab, if desired.
----

[IMPORTANT]
----
To ensure that you can run concurrent Event-Driven Ansible activations efficiently, you must set your maximum number of activations in proportion to the resources available on your cluster. You can do this by adjusting your Event-Driven Ansible settings in the YAML view.
When you activate an Event-Driven Ansible rulebook under standard conditions, it uses approximately 250 MB of memory. However, the actual memory consumption can vary significantly based on the complexity of your rules and the volume and size of the events processed. In scenarios where a large number of events are anticipated or the rulebook complexity is high, conduct a preliminary assessment of resource usage in a staging environment. This ensures that your maximum number of activations is based on the capacity of your resources.
----
6. Click btn:[YAML view] to update your YAML key values.
7. Copy and paste the following string at the end of the spec key value section:

```
extra_settings:
  - setting: EDA_MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS
    value: '12'
```

8. Click btn:[Create].
This deploys Event-Driven Ansible controller in the namespace you specified.

After a couple minutes when the installation is marked as Successful, you can find the URL for the Event-Driven Ansible UI on the Routes page in the OpenShift UI.
9. From the navigation panel, select menu:Networking[Routes] to find the new Route URL that has been created for you.

Routes are listed according to the name of your custom resource.
10. Click the new URL under the Location column to navigate to Event-Driven Ansible in the browser.
11. From the navigation panel, select menu:Workloads[Secrets] and locate the Admin Password k8s secret that was created for you, unless you specified a custom one.

Secrets are listed according to the name of your custom resource and appended with -admin-password.

[NOTE]
----
You can use the password value in the secret to log in to the Event-Driven Ansible controller UI. The default user is admin.
