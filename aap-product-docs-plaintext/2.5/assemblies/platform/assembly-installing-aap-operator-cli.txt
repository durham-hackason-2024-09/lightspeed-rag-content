# Installing Ansible Automation Platform Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

Use these instructions to install the Ansible Automation Platform Operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI) using the oc command.

# Prerequisites

* Access to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform using an account with operator installation permissions.
* The OpenShift Container Platform CLI oc command is installed on your local system. Refer to Installing the OpenShift CLI in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform product documentation for further information.

# Subscribing a namespace to an operator using the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

Use this procedure to subscribe a namespace to an operator.

1. Create a project for the operator.

```
oc new-project ansible-automation-platform
```

2. Create a file called sub.yaml.
3. Add the following YAML code to the sub.yaml file.

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
  name: ansible-automation-platform
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: ansible-automation-platform-operator
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - ansible-automation-platform
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ansible-automation-platform
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  channel: 'stable-2.5'
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ansible-automation-platform-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
---
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  replicas: 1
```


This file creates a Subscription object called ansible-automation-platform that subscribes the ansible-automation-platform namespace to the ansible-automation-platform-operator operator.

It then creates an AutomationController object called example in the ansible-automation-platform namespace.

To change the automation controller name from example, edit the name field in the kind: AutomationController section of sub.yaml and replace <automation_controller_name> with the name you want to use:

```
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: <automation_controller_name>
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
```

4. Run the oc apply command to create the objects specified in the sub.yaml file:

```
oc apply -f sub.yaml
```


To verify that the namespace has been successfully subscribed to the ansible-automation-platform-operator operator, run the oc get subs command:


```
$ oc get subs -n ansible-automation-platform
```


For further information about subscribing namespaces to operators, see Installing from OperatorHub using the CLI in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operators guide.

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform CLI to fetch the web address and the password of the Automation controller that you created.

# Fetching platform gateway login details from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

To login to the platform gateway, you need the web address and the password.

## Fetching the platform gateway web address

A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name.
When you created the platform gateway instance, a route was created for it.
The route inherits the name that you assigned to the platform gateway object in the YAML file.

Use the following command to fetch the routes:


```
oc get routes -n <platform_namespace>
```


In the following example, the example platform gateway is running in the ansible-automation-platform namespace.


```
$ oc get routes -n ansible-automation-platform

NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example   example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing          example-service   http   edge/Redirect   None
```


The address for the platform gateway instance is example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing.

## Fetching the platform gateway password

The YAML block for the platform gateway instance in sub.yaml assigns values to the name and admin_user keys.
Use these values in the following command to fetch the password for the platform gateway instance.


```
oc get secret/<your instance name>-<admin_user>-password -o yaml
```


The default value for admin_user is admin. Modify the command if you changed the admin username in sub.yaml.

The following example retrieves the password for a platform gateway object called example:


```
oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml
```


The password for the platform gateway instance is listed in the metadata field in the output:


```
$ oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: ODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzL
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: aap
    app.kubernetes.io/name: example
    app.kubernetes.io/operator-version: ""
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: example
  name: example-admin-password
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
```
