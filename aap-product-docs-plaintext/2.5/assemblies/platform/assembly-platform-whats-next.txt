# Post-installation steps

Whether you are a new Ansible Automation Platform user looking to start automating, or an existing administrator looking to migrate old Ansible content to your latest installed version of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, explore the next steps to begin using the new features of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

# Updating execution environment image locations

If you installed private automation hub separately from Ansible Automation Platform, you can update your execution environment image locations to point to your private automation hub.

1. Go to the directory that contains setup.sh
2. Create ./group_vars/automationcontroller by running the following command:

```
touch ./group_vars/automationcontroller
```

3. Paste the following content into ./group_vars/automationcontroller. Adjust the settings to fit your environment:

```
# Automation Hub Registry
registry_username: 'your-automation-hub-user'
registry_password: 'your-automation-hub-password'
registry_url: 'automationhub.example.org'
registry_verify_ssl: False

## Execution Environments
control_plane_execution_environment: 'automationhub.example.org/ee-supported-rhel8:latest'

global_job_execution_environments:
  - name: "Default execution environment"
    image: "automationhub.example.org/ee-supported-rhel8:latest"
  - name: "Minimal execution environment"
    image: "automationhub.example.org/ee-minimal-rhel8:latest"
```

4. Run the ./setup.sh script

```
$ ./setup.sh
```


1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform as a user with system administrator access.
2. Go to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Execution Environments].
3. In the Image column, confirm that the execution environment image location has changed from the default value of <registry url>/ansible-automation-platform-<version>/<image name>:<tag> to <automation hub url>/<image name>:<tag>.

# Benefits of automation mesh

The automation mesh component of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform simplifies the process of distributing automation across multi-site deployments. For enterprises with multiple isolated IT environments, automation mesh provides a consistent and reliable way to deploy and scale up automation across your execution nodes using a peer-to-peer mesh communication network.
