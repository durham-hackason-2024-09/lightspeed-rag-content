# Managing access with role based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts user access based on their role within an organization. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have to the network.
You can control what users can do with the components of Ansible Automation Platform at a broad or granular level depending on your RBAC policy. You can designate whether the user is a system administrator or normal user and align roles and access permissions with their positions within the organization.
Roles can be defined with multiple permissions that can then be assigned to resources, teams and users. The permissions that make up a role dictate what the assigned role allows. Permissions are allocated with only the access needed for a user to perform the tasks appropriate for their role.

# Organizations

An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, and resources. It is the highest level object in the Ansible Automation Platform object hierarchy. After you have created an organization, Ansible Automation Platform displays the organization details. You can then manage access and execution environments for the organization.
Ansible Automation Platform automatically creates a default organization and the system administrator is automatically assigned to this organization. If you have a Self-support level license, you have only the default organization available and must not delete it.


[NOTE]
----
Only Enterprise or Premium licenses can add new organizations.
----

Enterprise and Premium license users who want to add a new organization should refer to the Creating an organization.

# Teams

A team is a subdivision of an organization with associated users and resources. Teams provide a means to implement role-based access control schemes and delegate responsibilities across organizations. For instance, you can grant permissions to a team rather than each user on the team.
You can create as many teams as needed for your organization. Teams can only be assigned to one organization while an organization can be made up of multiple teams. Each team can be assigned roles, the same way roles are assigned for users. With teams you can assign credential ownership at scale, preventing the need to click through multiple interfaces to assign the same credentials to each individual user.

## Creating a team

You can create new teams, assign an organization to the team, and manage the users and administrators associated with each team.
Users associated with a team inherit the permissions associated with the team and any organization permissions to which the team has membership.
