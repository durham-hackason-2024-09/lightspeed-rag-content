# Hosts

A host is a system managed by Ansible Automation Platform, which may include a physical, virtual, cloud-based server, or other device.
Typically a host is an operating system instance.
Hosts are grouped in inventories and are sometimes referred to as a “nodes”.
Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as an inventory.
Once your inventory is defined, use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.
