# Automation controller logfiles

Automation controller logfiles can be accessed from two centralized locations:

* /var/log/tower/
* /var/log/supervisor/

In the /var/log/tower/ directory, you can view logfiles captured by:

* tower.log: Captures the log messages such as runtime errors that occur when the job is executed.
* callback_receiver.log: Captures callback receiver logs that handles callback events when running ansible jobs.
* dispatcher.log: Captures log messages for the automation controller dispatcher worker service.
* job_lifecycle.log: Captures details of the job run, whether it is blocked, and what condition is blocking it.
* management_playbooks.log: Captures the logs of management playbook runs, and isolated job runs such as copying the metadata.
* rsyslog.err: Captures rsyslog errors authenticating with external logging services when sending logs to them.
* task_system.log: Captures the logs of tasks that automation controller is running in the background, such as adding cluster instances and logs related to information gathering or processing for analytics.
* tower_rbac_migrations.log: Captures the logs for rbac database migration or upgrade.
* tower_system_tracking_migrations.log: Captures the logs of the controller system tracking migration or upgrade.
* wsbroadcast.log: Captures the logs of websocket connections in the controller nodes.

In the /var/log/supervisor/ directory, you can view logfiles captured by:

* awx-callback-receiver.log: Captures the log of callback receiver that handles callback events when running ansible jobs, managed by supervisord.
* awx-daphne.log: Captures the logs of Websocket communication of WebUI.
* awx-dispatcher.log: Captures the logs that occur when dispatching a task to an automation controller instance, such as when running a job.
* awx-rsyslog.log: Captures the logs for the rsyslog service.
* awx-uwsgi.log: Captures the logs related to uWSGI, which is an application server.
* awx-wsbroadcast.log: Captures the logs of the websocket service that is used by automation controller.
* failure-event-handler.stderr.log: Captures the standard errors for /usr/bin/failure-event-handler supervisord's subprocess.
* supervisord.log: Captures the logs related to supervisord itself.
* wsrelay.log: Captures the communication logs within the websocket relay server.
* ws_heartbeat.log: Captures the periodic checks on the health of services running on the host.
* rsyslog_configurer.log: Captures rsyslog configuration activity associated with authenticating with external logging services.

The /var/log/supervisor/ directory includes stdout files for all services as well.

You can expect the following log paths to be generated by services used by automation controller (and Ansible Automation Platform):

* /var/log/nginx/
* /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_log/
* /var/log/redis/

Error logs can be found in the following locations:

* Automation controller server errors are logged in /var/log/tower.
* Supervisors logs can be found in /var/log/supervisor/.
* Nginx web server errors are logged in the httpd error log.
* Configure other automation controller logging needs in /etc/tower/conf.d/.
