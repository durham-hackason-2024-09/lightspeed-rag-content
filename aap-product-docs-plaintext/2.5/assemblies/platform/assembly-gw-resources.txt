# Resources

You can manage user access to Ansible Automation Platform resources and what users can do with those resources. Users are granted access through the roles to which they are assigned or through roles inherited through the role hierarchy, for example, through the roles they inherit through team membership. Ansible Automation Platform resources differ depending on the functionality you are configuring. For example, resources can be job templates and projects for automation execution or decision environments and rulebook activations for automation decisions.

# Providing team access to a resource

You can grant users access based on their team membership. When you add a user as a member of a team, they inherit access to the roles and resources defined for that team.

1. From the navigation panel, select a resource to which you want to provide team access. For example, menu:Automation Execution[Templates].
2. Select the Team Access tab.
3. Click the checkbox beside the team to assign that team to your chosen type of resource and click btn:[Next].
4. Select the roles you want applied to the team for the chosen resource and click btn:[Next].
5. Review the settings and click btn:[Save]. A progress bar displays indicating whether the role assignments were successfully applied.
6. You can remove resource access for a team by selecting the - icon next to the team. This launches a confirmation dialog, asking you to confirm the removal.
