# Backup and recovery of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

To safeguard against unexpected data loss and application errors, it is critical that you perform periodic backups of your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployment. In addition to data loss prevention, backups allow you to fall back to a different deployment state.
