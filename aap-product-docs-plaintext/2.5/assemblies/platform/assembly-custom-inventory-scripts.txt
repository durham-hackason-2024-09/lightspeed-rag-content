If you use custom inventory scripts, migrate to sourcing these scripts from a project.
For more information, see Inventory File Importing, and Inventory sources in Using automation execution.

If you are setting up an inventory file, see Editing the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer inventory file and find examples specific to your setup.

If you are migrating to execution environments, see:

* Upgrading to execution environments.
* Creating and consuming execution environments.
* Automation mesh design patterns.
* Mesh Topology in the Ansible Automation Platform Upgrade and Migration Guide to validate your topology.

For more information about automation mesh on a VM-based installation, see the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform automation mesh guide for VM-based installations.

For more information about automation mesh on an operator-based installation, see the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform automation mesh for operator-based installations.

If you already have a mesh topology set up and want to view node type, node health, and specific details about each node, see Topology Viewer.
