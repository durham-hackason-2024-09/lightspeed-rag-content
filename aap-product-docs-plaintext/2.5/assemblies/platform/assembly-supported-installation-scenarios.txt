# Supported installation scenarios

Red Hat supports the following installations scenarios for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform:
To edit inventory file parameters to specify a supported installation scenario, see Inventory file examples based on installation scenarios in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide.

# Standalone automation controller with a database on the same node, or a non-installer managed database

This scenario includes installation of automation controller, including the web front end, REST API backend, and database on a single machine. It installs PostgreSQL, and configures the automation controller to use that as its database. This is considered the standard automation controller installation scenario.

# Standalone automation controller with an external managed database

This scenario includes installation of the automation controller server on a single machine and configures communication with a remote PostgreSQL instance as its database. This remote PostgreSQL can be a server you manage, or can be provided by a cloud service such as Amazon RDS.

# Single Event-Driven Ansible controller node with internal database

This scenario includes installation of Event-Driven Ansible controller on a single machine with an internal database. It installs an installer managed PostgreSQL that is similar to the automation controller installation scenario.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Automation controller must be installed before you populate the inventory file with the appropriate Event-Driven Ansible variables.
----

* Single automation controller, single automation hub, and single Event-Driven Ansible controller node with external (installer managed) database
* Appendix A.5. Event-Driven Ansible controller variables

# Standalone automation hub with a database on the same node, or a non-installer managed database

This scenario includes installation of automation hub, including the web frontend, REST API backend, and database on a single machine. It installs PostgreSQL, and configures the automation hub to use that as its database.

# Standalone automation hub with an external managed database

This scenario includes installation of the automation hub server on a single machine, and installs a remote PostgreSQL database, managed by the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer.

# Platform installation with a database on the automation controller node, or non-installer managed database

This scenario includes installation of automation controller and automation hub with a database on the automation controller node, or a non-installer managed database.

# Platform installation with an external managed database

This scenario includes installation of automation controller and automation hub and configures communication with a remote PostgreSQL instance as its database. This remote PostgreSQL can be a server you manage, or can be provided by a cloud service such as Amazon RDS.

# Multi-machine cluster installation with an external managed database

This scenario includes installation of multiple automation controller nodes and an automation hub instance and configures communication with a remote PostgreSQL instance as its database. This remote PostgreSQL can be a server you manage, or can be provided by a cloud service such as Amazon RDS. In this scenario, all automation controller are active and can execute jobs, and any node can receive HTTP requests.


[NOTE]
----
* Running in a cluster setup requires any database that automation controller uses to be external-&#8203;PostgreSQL must be installed on a machine that is not one of the primary or secondary tower nodes. When in a redundant setup, the remote PostgreSQL version requirements is PostgreSQL 13.
* See Clustering for more information on configuring a clustered setup.
* Provide a reachable IP address for the [automationhub] host to ensure users can sync content from Private Automation Hub from a different node.
