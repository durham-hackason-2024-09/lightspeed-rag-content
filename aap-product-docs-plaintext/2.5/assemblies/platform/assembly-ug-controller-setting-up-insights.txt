# Setting up Red Hat Insights for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Remediations

Automation controller supports integration with Red Hat Insights.
When a host is registered with Red Hat Insights, it is scanned continually for vulnerabilities and known configuration conflicts.
Each problem identified can have an associated fix in the form of an Ansible Playbook.
Red Hat Insights users create a maintenance plan to group the fixes and can create a playbook to mitigate the problems.
Automation controller tracks the maintenance plan playbooks through a Red Hat Insights project.
Authentication to Red Hat Insights through Basic Authorization is backed by a special credential, which must first be established in automation controller.
To run a Red Hat Insights maintenance plan, you need a Red Hat Insights project and inventory.
