# Setting up social authentication

Authentication methods simplify logins for end users, offering single sign-ons by using existing login information to sign in to a third party website rather than creating a new login account specifically for that website.
You can configure account authentication in the User Interface and save it to the PostgreSQL database.
You can configure account authentication in automation controller to centrally use OAuth2, while you can configure enterprise-level account authentication for SAML, RADIUS, or even LDAP as a source for authentication information.
For websites, such as Microsoft Azure, Google, or GitHub, which give account information, account information is often implemented by using the OAuth standard.
OAuth is a secure authorization protocol.
It is commonly used in conjunction with account authentication to grant third party applications a "session token" allowing them to make API calls to providers on the user's behalf.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based, open-standard data format for exchanging account authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.
The RADIUS distributed client/server system enables you to secure networks against unauthorized access.
You can implement this in network environments requiring high levels of security while maintaining network access for remote users.
For more information, see the Automation controller configuration section.

# Configuring GitHub authentication

You can connect GitHub identities to Ansible Automation Platform using OAuth. To set up GitHub authentication, you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from GitHub using the registering the new application with GitHub.

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See Displaying authenticator details for instructions on accessing this information.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Authentication Methods].
2. Click btn:[Create authentication].
3. Select GitHub from the Authentication type list and click btn:[Next].
4. Enter a Name for this authentication configuration.
5. When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret:
1. Copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the GitHub OAuth2 Key field.
2. Copy and paste the GitHub Client Secret into the GitHub OAuth2 Secret field.
6. Optional: Enter any Additional Authenticator Fields that this authenticator can take. These fields are not validated and are passed directly back to the authenticator.

[NOTE]
----
Values defined in this field override the dedicated fields provided in the UI.
----
7. To automatically create organizations, users, and teams upon successful login, select Create objects.
8. To enable this authentication method upon creation, select Enabled.
9. To remove a user for any groups they were previously added to when they authenticate from this source, select Remove users.
10. Click btn:[Next].

To control which users are allowed into the Ansible Automation Platform server, and placed into Ansible Automation Platform organizations or teams based on their attributes (like username and email address) or to what groups they belong, continue to Mapping.

To verify that the authentication is configured correctly, log out of Ansible Automation Platform and check that the login screen displays the logo of your authentication chosen method to enable logging in with those credentials.
