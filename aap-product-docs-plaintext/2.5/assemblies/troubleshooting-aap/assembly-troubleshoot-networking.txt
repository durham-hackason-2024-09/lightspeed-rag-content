# Issue - The default subnet used in Ansible Automation Platform containers conflicts with the internal network

The default subnet used in Ansible Automation Platform containers conflicts with the internal network resulting in "No route to host" errors.

To resolve this issue, update the default classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) value so it does not conflict with the CIDR used by the default Podman networking plugin.

1. In all controller and hybrid nodes, run the following commands to create a file called custom.py:

```
# touch /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py
```


```
# chmod 640 /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py
```


```
# chown root:awx /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py
```

2. Add the following to the /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py file:

```
DEFAULT_CONTAINER_RUN_OPTIONS = ['--network', 'slirp4netns:enable_ipv6=true,cidr=192.0.2.0/24']
```

* 192.0.2.0/24 is the value for the new CIDR in this example.
3. Stop and start the automation controller service in all controller and hybrid nodes:

```
# automation-controller-service stop
```


```
# automation-controller-service start
```


All containers will start on the new CIDR.
