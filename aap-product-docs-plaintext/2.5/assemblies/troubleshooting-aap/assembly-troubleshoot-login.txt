# Issue - Logging in to the automation controller UI results in “Invalid username or password. Please try again.”

When you try to log in to the automation controller UI, the login fails and you see the error message: “Invalid username or password. Please try again.”.

One reason this could be happening is if the value for Maximum number of simultaneous logged in sessions is 0. The Maximum number of simultaneous logged in sessions value determines the maximum number of sessions allowed per user per device. If this value is 0, no users can log in to automation controller.

The default value is -1, which disables the maximum sessions allowed. This means that you can have as many sessions without an imposed limit.

* As root user, run the following command from the command line to set the SESSIONS_PER_USER variable to -1 which disables the maximum sessions allowed:

```
# echo "settings.SESSIONS_PER_USER = -1" | awx-manage shell_plus --quiet
```


* Verify that you can log in successfully to automation controller.
