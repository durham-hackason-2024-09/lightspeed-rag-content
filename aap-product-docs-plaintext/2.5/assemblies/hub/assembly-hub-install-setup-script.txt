# Verifying Red Hat Single Sign-On connection

The installer uses the Red Hat Single Sign-On variables to setup a Keycloak realm and client.

To verify that you have successfully connected to the existing Red Hat Single Sign-On installation, check that settings.py contains the Red Hat Single Sign-On host information, the realm name, the key, and the secret.
