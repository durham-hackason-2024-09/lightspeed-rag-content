# Managing remote configurations in automation hub

You can set up remote configurations to any server that is running automation hub. Remote configurations allow you to sync content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.

# Creating a remote configuration in automation hub

You can use Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to create a remote configuration to an external collection source. Then, you can sync the content from those collections to your custom repositories.

1. Log in to automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Remotes].
3. Click btn:[Add Remote].
4. Enter a Name for the remote configuration.
5. Enter the URL for the remote server, including the path for the specific repository.

[NOTE]
----
To find the remote server URL and repository path, navigate to menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories], select your repository, and click btn:[Copy CLI configuration].
----
6. Configure the credentials to the remote server by entering a Token or Username and Password required to access the external collection.

[NOTE]
----
To generate a token from the navigation panel, select menu:Collections[API token], click btn:[Load token] and copy the token that is loaded.
----
7. To access collections from console.redhat.com, enter the SSO URL to sign in to the identity provider (IdP).
8. Select or create a YAML requirements file to identify the collections and version ranges to synchronize with your custom repository. For example, to download only the kubernetes and AWS collection versions 5.0.0 or later the requirements file would look like this:

```
Collections:
 	  - name: community.kubernetes
	  - name: community.aws
 		version:”>=5.0.0”
```


[NOTE]
----
All collection dependencies are downloaded during the Sync process.
----
9. Optional: To configure your remote further, use the options available under Advanced configuration:
1. If there is a corporate proxy in place for your organization, enter a Proxy URL, Proxy Username and Proxy Password.
2. Enable or disable transport layer security using the TLS validation checkbox.
3. If digital certificates are required for authentication, enter a Client key and Client certificate.
4. If you are using a self-signed SSL certificate for your server, enter the PEM encoded client certificate used for authentication in the CA certificate field.
5. To accelerate the speed at which collections in this remote can be downloaded, specify the number of collections that can be downloaded in tandem in the Download concurrency field.
6. To limit the number of queries per second on this remote, specify a Rate Limit.

[NOTE]
----
Some servers can have a specific rate limit set, and if exceeded, synchronization fails.
----

4. Select the Access tab.
5. Select a group for Repository owners. See Configuring user access for your private automation hub for information about implementing user access.
6. Select the appropriate roles for the selected group.
