# Connecting automation hub to a Red Hat Single Sign-On environment

To connect automation hub to a Red Hat Single Sign-On installation, configure inventory variables in the inventory file before you run the installer setup script.
You must configure a different set of variables when connecting to a Red Hat Single Sign-On installation managed by Ansible Automation Platform than when connecting to an external Red Hat Single Sign-On installation.
