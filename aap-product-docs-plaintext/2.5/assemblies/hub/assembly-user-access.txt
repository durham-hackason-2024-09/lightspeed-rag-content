# Configuring user access for your private automation hub

You can manage user access to content and features in automation hub by creating groups of users that have specific permissions.

# Implementing user access

User access is based on managing permissions to system objects (users, groups, namespaces) rather than by assigning permissions individually to specific users.

You assign permissions to the groups that you create. You can then assign users to these groups. This means that each user in a group has the permissions assigned to that group.

Groups created in private automation hub can range from system administrators responsible for governing internal collections, configuring user access, and repository management to groups with access to organize and upload internally developed content to the private automation hub.

* See Automation Hub permissions for information on system permissions.

# Enable view-only access for your private automation hub

By enabling view-only access, you can grant access for users to view collections or namespaces on your private automation hub without requiring them to log in. View-only access allows you to share content with unauthorized users while restricting their ability to view or download source code. They will not have permissions to edit anything on your private automation hub.

To enable view-only access for your private automation hub, you must edit the inventory file on your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer.

* If you are installing a new instance of Ansible Automation Platform, add the automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_access and automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_download parameters to your inventory file along with your other installation configurations:
* If you are updating an existing Ansible Automation Platform installation to include view-only access, add the automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_access and automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_download parameters to your inventory file and then run the setup.sh script to apply the updates:

1. Navigate to the installer.
Bundled installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-<latest-version>
```

Online installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-<latest-version>
```

2. Open the inventory file with a text editor.
3. Add the automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_access and automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_download parameters to the inventory file and set both to True, following the example below:

```
[all:vars]

automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_access = True 1
automationhub_enable_unauthenticated_collection_download = True 2
```

Allows unauthorized users to view collections
Allows unathorized users to download collections
4. Run the setup.sh script. The installer enables view-only access to your private automation hub.

After the installation is complete, verify that you have view-only access on your private automation hub by attempting to view content on your private automation hub without logging in.
