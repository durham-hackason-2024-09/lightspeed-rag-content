# Private automation hub

Ansible automation hub is the central repository place for the certified collections, and functions as the main source of trusted, tested and supported content.
With private automation hub, automation developers can collaborate and publish their own automation content and deliver Ansible code more easily within their organization.
It is also the central repository for Ansible validated content, which is not supported, but is trusted and tested by Red Hat and our partners.

 Setting up the shared filesystem

You must mount the shared file system on each automation hub node:

1. Create the /var/lib/pulp directory.

```
# mkdir /var/lib/pulp
```

2. Mount the shared filesystem (this reference environment uses an NFS share).

```
# mount -t nfs4 <nfs_share_ip_address>:/ /var/lib/pulp
```

3. Confirm that the shared filesystem is successfully mounted:

```
$ df -h
```


# Enabling firewall services

Because of the requirement of using a shared filesystem as part of a highly available Ansible automation hub environment, the following firewall services must be enabled to ensure that the filesystem is successfully mounted.

On each Ansible automation hub node, you must:

1. Ensure the following firewalld services (nfs, mountd, rpc-bind) are enabled.

```
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=nfs
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=mountd
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=rpc-bind
```

2. Reload firewalld for changes to take effect.

```
# firewall-cmd --reload
```

3. Verify the firewalld services are enabled.

```
# firewall-cmd --get-services
```
