# Ansible validated content

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform includes Ansible validated content, which complements existing Red Hat Ansible Certified Content.
Ansible validated content provides an expert-led path for performing operational tasks on a variety of platforms from both Red Hat and our trusted partners.

# Configuring validated collections with the installer

When you download and run the bundle installer, certified and validated collections are automatically uploaded.
Certified collections are uploaded into the rh-certified repository.
Validated collections are uploaded into the validated repository.

You can change to default configuration by using two variables:

* automationhub_seed_collections is a boolean that defines whether or not preloading is enabled.
* automationhub_collection_seed_repository. A variable that enables you to specify the type of content to upload when it is set to true.
Possible values are certified or validated.
If missing both content sets will be uploaded.

# Installing validated content using the tarball

If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a standalone tarball, ansible-validated-content-bundle-1.tar.gz.
You can also use this standalone tarball later to update validated contents in any environment, when a newer tarball becomes available, without having to re-run the bundle installer.

You require the following variables to run the playbook.



1. To obtain the tarball, navigate to the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform download page and select Ansible Validated Content.
2. Upload the content and define the variables (this example uses automationhub_api_token):

```
ansible-playbook collection_seed.yml
-e automationhub_api_token=<api_token>
-e automationhub_main_url=https://automationhub.example.com
-e automationhub_require_content_approval=true
```


[NOTE]
----
Use either automationhub_admin_password or automationhub_api_token, not both.
----

When complete, the collections are visible in the validated collection section of private automation hub.
Users can now view and download collections from your private automation hub.
