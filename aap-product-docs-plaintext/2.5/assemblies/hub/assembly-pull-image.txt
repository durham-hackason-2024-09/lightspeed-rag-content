# Pulling images from a container repository

Pull images from the automation hub container registry to make a copy to your local machine.
Automation hub provides the podman pull command for each latest image in the container repository.
You can copy and paste this command into your terminal, or use podman pull to copy an image based on an image tag.

# Pulling an image

You can pull images from the automation hub container registry to make a copy to your local machine.

* You must have permission to view and pull from a private container repository.

1. If you are pulling container images from a password or token-protected registry, create a credential in automation controller before pulling the image.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
3. Select your container repository.
4. In the Pull this image entry, click btn:[Copy to clipboard].
5. Paste and run the command in your terminal.

* Run podman images to view images on your local machine.

# Syncing images from a container repository

You can pull images from the automation hub container registry to sync an image to your local machine.
To sync an image from a remote container registry, you must first configure a remote registry.

You must have permission to view and pull from a private container repository.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
2. Add https://registry.redhat.io to the registry.
3. Add any required credentials to authenticate.

[NOTE]
----
Some container registries are aggressive with rate limiting.
Set a rate limit under Advanced Options.
----
4. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
5. Click btn:[Add execution environment] in the page header.
6. Select the registry you want to pull from.
The Name field displays the name of the image displayed on your local registry.

[NOTE]
----
The Upstream name field is the name of the image on the remote server.
For example, if the upstream name is set to "alpine" and the Name field is "local/alpine", the alpine image is downloaded from the remote and renamed to "local/alpine".
----
7. Set a list of tags to include or exclude.
Syncing images with a large number of tags is time consuming and uses a lot of disk space.

* See Red Hat Container Registry Authentication for a list of registries.
* See the What is Podman? documentation for options to use when pulling images.
