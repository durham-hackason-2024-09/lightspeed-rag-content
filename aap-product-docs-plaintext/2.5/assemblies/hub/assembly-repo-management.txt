# Repository management with automation hub

As an automation hub administrator, you can create, edit, delete, and move automation content collections between repositories.

# Types of repositories in automation hub

In automation hub you can publish collections to two types of repositories, depending on whether you want your collection to be verified:

Staging repositories:: Any user with permission to upload to a namespace can publish collections into these repositories. Collections in these repositories are not available in the search page. Instead, they are displayed on the approval dashboard for an administrator to verify. Staging repositories are marked with the pipeline=staging label.
Custom repositories:: Any user with write permissions on the repository can publish collections to these repositories. Custom repositories can be public where all users can see them, or private  where only users with view permissions can see them. These repositories are not displayed on the approval dashboard. If the repository owner enables search, the collection can appear in search results.

By default, automation hub ships with one staging repository that is automatically used when a repository is not specified for uploading collections. Users can create new staging repositories during repository creation.

# Approval pipeline for custom repositories in automation hub

In automation hub you can approve collections into any repository marked with the pipeline=approved label. By default, automation hub includes one repository for approved content, but you have the option to add more from the repository creation screen. You cannot directly publish into a repository marked with the pipeline=approved label. A collection must first go through a staging repository and be approved before being published into a 'pipleline=approved' repository.

Auto approval:: When auto approve is enabled, any collection you upload to a staging repository is automatically promoted to all of the repositories marked as pipeline=approved.
Approval required:: When auto approve is disabled, the administrator can view the approval dashboard and see collections that have been uploaded into any of the staging repositories. Clicking btn:[Approve] displays a list of approved repositories. From this list, the administrator can select one or more repositories to which the content should be promoted.

If only one approved repository exists, the collection is automatically promoted into it and the administrator is not prompted to select a repository.
Rejection:: Rejected collections are automatically placed into the rejected repository, which is pre-installed.

# Role based access control to restrict access to custom repositories

Use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict user access to custom repositories by defining access permissions based on user roles. By default, users can view all public repositories in their automation hub, but they cannot modify a repository unless their role allows them access to do so. The same logic applies to other operations on the repository. For example, you can remove a user&#8217;s ability to download content from a custom repository by changing their role permissions. See Configuring user access for your private automation hub for information about managing user access in automation hub.

# Creating a custom repository in automation hub

When you use Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform to create a repository, you can configure the repository to be private or hide it from search results.

1. Log in to automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Click btn:[Add repository].
4. Enter a Repository name.
5. In the Description field, describe the purpose of the repository.
6. To retain previous versions of your repository each time you make a change, select Retained number of versions. The number of retained versions can range anywhere between 0 and unlimited. To save all versions, leave this set to null.

[NOTE]
----
If you have a problem with a change to your custom repository, you can revert to a different repository version that you have retained.
----
7. In the Pipeline field, select a pipeline for the repository. This option defines who can publish a collection into the repository.
Staging:: Anyone is allowed to publish automation content into the repository.
Approved:: Collections added to this repository are required to go through the approval process by way of the staging repository. When auto approve is enabled, any collection uploaded to a staging repository is automatically promoted to all of the approved repositories.
None:: Any user with permissions on the repository can publish to the repository directly, and the repository is not part of the approval pipeline.
8. Optional: To hide the repository from search results, select Hide from search. This option is selected by default.
9. Optional: To make the repository private, select Make private. This hides the repository from anyone who does not have permissions to view the repository.
10. To sync the content from a remote repository into this repository, select Remote and select the remote that contains the collections you want included in your custom repository. For more information, see Repository sync.
11. Click btn:[Save].

* After the repository is created, the details page is displayed.

From here, you can provide access to your repository, review or add collections, and work with the saved versions of your custom repository.

# Providing access to a custom automation hub repository

By default, private repositories and the automation content collections are hidden from all users in the system. Public repositories can be viewed by all users, but cannot be modified. Use this procedure to provide access to your custom repository.

1. Log in to private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Locate your repository in the list and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then select Edit.
4. Select the Access tab.
5. Select a group for Repository owners.

See Configuring user access for your private automation hub for information about implementing user access.
6. Select the roles you want assigned to the selected group.
7. Click btn:[Save].

# Adding collections to an automation hub repository

After you create your repository, you can begin adding automation content collections to it.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
2. Locate your repository in the list and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then select Edit.
3. Select the Collections version tab.
4. Click btn:[Add Collection] and select the collections that you want to add to your repository.
5. Click btn:[Select].

# Revert to a different automation hub repository version

When automation content collections are added or removed from a repository, a new version is created. If a change to your repository causes a problem, you can revert to a previous version. Reverting is a safe operation and does not delete collections from the system, but rather, changes the content associated with the repository. The number of versions saved is defined in the Retained number of versions setting when a repository is created.

1. Log in to private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Locate your repository in the list and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then select Edit.
4. Locate the version you want to revert to and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, and select Revert to this version.
5. Click btn:[Revert].
