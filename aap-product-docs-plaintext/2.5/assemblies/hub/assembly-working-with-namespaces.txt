# Using namespaces to manage collections in automation hub

Namespaces are unique locations in automation hub to which you can upload and publish content collections. Access to namespaces in automation hub is governed by groups with permission to manage the content and related information that appears there.
You can use namespaces in automation hub to organize collections developed within your organization for internal distribution and use.
If you are working with namespaces, you must have a group that has permissions to create, edit and upload collections to namespaces. Collections uploaded to a namespace require administrative approval before you can publish them and make them available for use.

# Creating a new group for content curators

You can create a new group in private automation hub designed to support content curation in your organization. This group can contribute internally developed collections for publication in private automation hub.

To help content developers create a namespace and upload their internally developed collections to private automation hub, you must first create and edit a group and assign the required permissions.

* You have administrative permissions in private automation hub and can create groups.

1. Log in to your private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:User Access[Groups] and click btn:[Create].

The new group is created with the permissions that you assigned. You can then add users to the group.

8. Click btn:[Add].

# Creating a namespace

You can create a namespace to organize collections that your content developers upload to automation hub.
When creating a namespace, you can assign a group in automation hub as owners of that namespace.

# Adding additional information and resources to a namespace

You can add information and provide resources for your users to accompany collections included in the namespace. Add a logo and a description, and link users to your GitHub repository, issue tracker, or other online assets. You can also enter markdown text in the Edit resources tab to include more information. This is helpful to users who use your collection in their automation tasks.

# Uploading collections to your namespaces

You can upload internally developed collections in tar.gz file format to your private automation hub namespace for review and approval by an automation hub administrator.
When approved, the collection moves to the Published content repository where automation hub users can view and download it.
