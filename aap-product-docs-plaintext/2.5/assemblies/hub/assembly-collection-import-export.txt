# Exporting and importing collections in automation hub

Ansible automation hub stores automation content collections within repositories. These collections are versioned by the automation content creator. Many versions of the same collection can exist in the same or different repositories at the same time.
Collections are stored as .tar files that can be imported and exported. This storage format ensures that the collection you are importing to a new repository is the same one that was originally created and exported.

After collections are finalized, you can import them to a location where they can be distributed to others across your organization.

As an automation content creator, you can import a collection to use in a custom repository. To use a collection in your custom repository, you must first import the collection into your namespace so the automation hub administrator can approve it.

1. Log in to automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces]. The Namespaces page displays all of the namespaces available.
3. Click btn:[View Collections].
4. Click btn:[Upload Collection].
5. Navigate to the collection tarball file, select the file and click btn:[Open].
6. Click btn:[Upload].

The My Imports screen displays a summary of tests and notifies you if the collection upload is successful or has failed.

[NOTE]
