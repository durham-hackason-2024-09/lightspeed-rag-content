# Synchronizing Ansible Content Collections in automation hub


[IMPORTANT]
----
As of the 2.4 release you can still synchronize content, but synclists are deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
To synchronize content, you can now upload a manually-created requirements file from the rh-certified remote.
Remotes are configurations that enable you to synchronize content to your custom repositories from an external collection source.
----
You can use Ansible automation hub to distribute the relevant Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections to your users by creating synclists or a requirements file. For more information about using requirements files, see Install multiple collections with a requirements file in the Using Ansible collections guide.

# Explanation of Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections synclists

A synclist is a curated group of Red Hat Certified Collections that is assembled by your organization administrator.
It synchronizes with your local Ansible automation hub.
Use synclists to manage only the content that you want and exclude unnecessary collections.
Design and manage your synclist from the content available as part of Red Hat content on console.redhat.com

Each synclist has its own unique repository URL that you can use to designate as a remote source for content in automation hub.
You securely access each synclist by using an API token.

# Creating a synclist of Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections

You can create a synclist of curated Red Hat Ansible Certified Content in Ansible automation hub on console.redhat.com.
Your synclist repository is located on the automation hub navigation panel under menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories], which is updated whenever you manage content within Ansible Certified Content Collections.

All Ansible Certified Content Collections are included by default in your initial organization synclist.

* You have a valid Ansible Automation Platform subscription.
* You have Organization Administrator permissions for console.redhat.com.
* The following domain names are part of either the firewall or the proxy's allowlist.
They are required for successful connection and download of collections from automation hub or Galaxy server:
* galaxy.ansible.com
* cloud.redhat.com
* console.redhat.com
* sso.redhat.com
* Ansible automation hub resources are stored in Amazon Simple Storage.
The following domain names must be in the allow list:
* automation-hub-prd.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
* ansible-galaxy.s3.amazonaws.com
* SSL inspection is disabled either when using self signed certificates or for the Red Hat domains.

1. Log in to console.redhat.com.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Collections].
3. Set the toggle switch on each collection to exclude or include it on your synclist.
4. To initiate the remote repository synchronization, navigate to automation hub and select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
5. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942; and select Sync to initiate the remote repository synchronization to your private automation hub.
6. Optional: If your remote repository is already configured, update the collections content that you made available to local users by manually synchronizing Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections to your private automation hub.
