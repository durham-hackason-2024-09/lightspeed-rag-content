# Synchronizing repositories in automation hub

You can distribute relevant automation content collections to your users by synchronizing repositories from one automation hub to another. To ensure you have the latest collection updates, synchronize your custom repository with the remote regularly.

1. Log in to automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Locate your repository in the list and click Sync.

All collections in the configured remote are downloaded to your custom repository. To check the status of the collection sync, select menu:Automation Content[Task Management] from the navigation panel.

[NOTE]
----
To limit repository synchronization to specific collections within a remote, you can identify specific collections to be pulled by using a requirements.yml file. See Create a remote for more information.
