# Creating the API token in automation hub

Before you can interact with automation hub by uploading or downloading collections, you must create an API token. The automation hub API token authenticates your ansible-galaxy client to the Red Hat automation hub server.
Your method for creating the API token differs according to the type of automation hub that you are using:
* Automation hub uses Offline token management. See Creating the API token in automation hub.
* Private automation hub uses API token management. See Creating the API token in private automation hub.

# Keeping your offline token active

Offline tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. You can keep your offline token from expiring by periodically refreshing your offline token.

Keeping an online token active is useful when an application performs an action on behalf of the user; for example, this allows the application to perform a routine data backup when the user is offline.


[NOTE]
----
If your offline token expires, you must request a new one.
----

* Run the following command to prevent your token from expiring:

```
curl https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=refresh_token -d client_id="cloud-services" -d refresh_token="{{ user_token }}" --fail --silent --show-error --output /dev/null
```
