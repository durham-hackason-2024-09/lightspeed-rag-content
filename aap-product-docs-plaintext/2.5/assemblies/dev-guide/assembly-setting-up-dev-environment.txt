# Setting up your development environment

You can follow the procedures in this section to set up your development environment to create automation execution environments.

# Installing Ansible Builder

* You have installed the Podman container runtime.
* You have valid subscriptions attached on the host. Doing so allows you to access the subscription-only resources needed to install ansible-builder, and ensures that the necessary repository for ansible-builder is automatically enabled. See Attaching your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription for more information.

* In your terminal, run the following command to install Ansible Builder and activate your Ansible Automation Platform repo:

```
#  dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms ansible-builder
```


# Installing automation content navigator on RHEL from an RPM

You can install automation content navigator on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) from an RPM.

* You have installed Python 3.10 or later.
* You have installed RHEL 8.6 or later.
* You registered your system with Red Hat Subscription Manager.


[NOTE]
----
Ensure that you only install the navigator matching your current Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform environment.
----

1. Attach the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform SKU:

```
$ subscription-manager attach --pool=<sku-pool-id>
```

2. Install automation content navigator with the following command:

v.2.5 for RHEL 8 for x86_64

```
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms ansible-navigator
```


v.2.5 for RHEL 9 for x86-64

```
$ sudo dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms ansible-navigator
```


* Verify your automation content navigator installation:

```
$ ansible-navigator --help
```


The following example demonstrates a successful installation:

![automation content navigator successful installation]

# Downloading base automation execution environments

Base images that ship with Ansible Automation Platform 2.0 are hosted on the Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog (registry.redhat.io).

* You have a valid Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription.

1. Log in to registry.redhat.io

```
$ podman login registry.redhat.io
```

2. Pull the base images from the registry

```
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/aap/<image name>
```
