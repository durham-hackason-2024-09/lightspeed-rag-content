# Ansible developer tools

Ansible developer tools (ansible-dev-tools) is a suite of tools provided with Ansible Automation Platform to help automation creators to
create, test, and deploy playbook projects, execution environments, and collections.
The Ansible VS Code extension by Red Hat integrates most of the Ansible developer tools:
you can use these tools from the VS Code user interface.
Use Ansible developer tools during local development of playbooks, local testing, and in a CI pipeline (linting and testing).
This document describes how to use Ansible developer tools to create a playbook project that contains playbooks and roles that you can reuse within the project.
It also describes how to test the playbooks and deploy the project on your {AAP} instance so that you can use the playbooks in automation jobs.

# Ansible developer tools components

* Write playbooks with the help of syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
* Debug your playbooks with a linter.
* Execute playbooks with Ansible Core using ansible-playbook.

From the VS Code extension, you can also connect to Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM watsonx Code Assistant.
