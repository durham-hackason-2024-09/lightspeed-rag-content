2. Push your project up to a source control system such as GitHub.

# Running your playbook in Ansible Automation Platform

To run your playbook in Ansible Automation Platform, you must create a project in automation controller for the repository where you stored your playbook project.
You can then create a job template for each playbook from the project.

2. Configure a Source Control credential type for your source control system if necessary. See the Creating new credentials section of the Automation controller user guide for more details.
3. In automation controller, create a project for the GitHub repository where you stored your playbook project.
Refer to the Projects chapter of the Automation controller user guide.
4. Create a job template that uses a playbook from the project that you created.
Refer to the Job Templates chapter of the Automation controller user guide.
5. Run your playbook from automation controller by launching the job template. Refer to the Launching a job template section of the Automation controller user guide.
