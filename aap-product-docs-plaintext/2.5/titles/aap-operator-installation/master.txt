# Planning your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator installation on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform is supported on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Openshift.

OpenShift operators help install and automate day-2 operations of complex, distributed software on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The Ansible Automation Platform Operator enables you to deploy and manage Ansible Automation Platform components on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

You can use this section to help plan your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation on your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment. Before installing, review the supported installation scenarios to determine which meets your requirements.

## About Ansible Automation Platform Operator

The Ansible Automation Platform Operator provides cloud-native, push-button deployment of new Ansible Automation Platform instances in your OpenShift environment.
The Ansible Automation Platform Operator includes resource types to deploy and manage instances of automation controller and private automation hub.
It also includes automation controller job resources for defining and launching jobs inside your automation controller deployments.

Deploying Ansible Automation Platform instances with a Kubernetes native operator offers several advantages over launching instances from a playbook deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, including upgrades and full lifecycle support for your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployments.

You can install the Ansible Automation Platform Operator from the Red Hat Operators catalog in OperatorHub.

## OpenShift Container Platform version compatibility

The Ansible Automation Platform Operator to install Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 is available on OpenShift Container Platform 4.9 and later versions.

* See the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Life Cycle for the most current compatibility details.

## Supported installation scenarios for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

You can use the OperatorHub on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

Alternatively, you can install Ansible Automation Platform Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI), oc. See  for help with this.

After you have installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator you must create an Ansible Automation Platform custom resource (CR). This enables you to manage Ansible Automation Platform components from a single unified interface known as the platform gateway. As of version 2.5, you must create an Ansible Automation Platform CR, even if you have an existing automation controller,  automation hub, or Event-Driven Ansible, components.

If existing components have already been deployed, you must specify these components on the Ansible Automation Platform CR. You must create the custom resource in the same namespace as the existing components.



## Custom resources

You can define custom resources for each primary installation workflows.

## Additional resources

* See Understanding OperatorHub to learn more about OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub.

# Installing the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

* You have installed the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform catalog in OperatorHub.
* You have created a StorageClass object for your platform and a persistent volume claim (PVC) with ReadWriteMany access mode. See Dynamic provisioning for details.
* To run Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with ReadWriteMany access mode, you must add NFS or other storage.
* For information about the AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) or to use the aws-ebs storage class, see Persistent storage using AWS Elastic Block Store.
* To use multi-attach ReadWriteMany access mode for AWS EBS, see Attaching a volume to multiple instances with Amazon EBS Multi-Attach.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to .
3. Search for Ansible Automation Platform and click Install.
4. Select an Update Channel:
* stable-2.x: installs a namespace-scoped operator, which limits deployments of automation hub and automation controller instances to the namespace the operator is installed in. This is suitable for most cases. The stable-2.x channel does not require administrator privileges and utilizes fewer resources because it only monitors a single namespace.
* stable-2.x-cluster-scoped: deploys automation hub and automation controller across multiple namespaces in the cluster and requires administrator privileges for all namespaces in the cluster.
5. Select Installation Mode, Installed Namespace, and Approval Strategy.
6. Click Install.

The installation process will begin. When installation is complete, a modal will appear notifying you that the Ansible Automation Platform Operator is installed in the specified namespace.

* Click View Operator to view your newly installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

# Installing Ansible Automation Platform Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

Use these instructions to install the Ansible Automation Platform Operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform from the OpenShift Container Platform command-line interface (CLI) using the oc command.

## Prerequisites

* Access to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform using an account with operator installation permissions.
* The OpenShift Container Platform CLI oc command is installed on your local system. Refer to Installing the OpenShift CLI in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform product documentation for further information.

## Subscribing a namespace to an operator using the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

Use this procedure to subscribe a namespace to an operator.

1. Create a project for the operator.

```
oc new-project ansible-automation-platform
```

2. Create a file called sub.yaml.
3. Add the following YAML code to the sub.yaml file.

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
  name: ansible-automation-platform
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: ansible-automation-platform-operator
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
    - ansible-automation-platform
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ansible-automation-platform
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  channel: 'stable-2.5'
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ansible-automation-platform-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
---
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
spec:
  replicas: 1
```


This file creates a Subscription object called ansible-automation-platform that subscribes the ansible-automation-platform namespace to the ansible-automation-platform-operator operator.

It then creates an AutomationController object called example in the ansible-automation-platform namespace.

To change the automation controller name from example, edit the name field in the kind: AutomationController section of sub.yaml and replace <automation_controller_name> with the name you want to use:

```
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: <automation_controller_name>
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
```

4. Run the oc apply command to create the objects specified in the sub.yaml file:

```
oc apply -f sub.yaml
```


To verify that the namespace has been successfully subscribed to the ansible-automation-platform-operator operator, run the oc get subs command:


```
$ oc get subs -n ansible-automation-platform
```


For further information about subscribing namespaces to operators, see Installing from OperatorHub using the CLI in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Operators guide.

You can use the OpenShift Container Platform CLI to fetch the web address and the password of the Automation controller that you created.

## Fetching platform gateway login details from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

To login to the platform gateway, you need the web address and the password.

### Fetching the platform gateway web address

A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name.
When you created the platform gateway instance, a route was created for it.
The route inherits the name that you assigned to the platform gateway object in the YAML file.

Use the following command to fetch the routes:


```
oc get routes -n <platform_namespace>
```


In the following example, the example platform gateway is running in the ansible-automation-platform namespace.


```
$ oc get routes -n ansible-automation-platform

NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example   example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing          example-service   http   edge/Redirect   None
```


The address for the platform gateway instance is example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing.

### Fetching the platform gateway password

The YAML block for the platform gateway instance in sub.yaml assigns values to the name and admin_user keys.
Use these values in the following command to fetch the password for the platform gateway instance.


```
oc get secret/<your instance name>-<admin_user>-password -o yaml
```


The default value for admin_user is admin. Modify the command if you changed the admin username in sub.yaml.

The following example retrieves the password for a platform gateway object called example:


```
oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml
```


The password for the platform gateway instance is listed in the metadata field in the output:


```
$ oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: ODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzL
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: aap
    app.kubernetes.io/name: example
    app.kubernetes.io/operator-version: ""
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: example
  name: example-admin-password
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
```

            file_storage_storage_class: your-rwx-storage-class
            file_storage_size: 10Gi

            ## uncomment if using S3 storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: S3
            # object_storage_s3_secret: example-galaxy-object-storage

            ## uncomment if using Azure storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: azure
            # object_storage_azure_secret: azure-secret-name
          lightspeed:
            disabled: true
```

1. For new components, if you do not specify a name, a default name is generated.
8. Click Create.
9. To access your new instance, see .


[NOTE]
----
If you have an existing controller with a managed Postgres pod, after creating the Ansible Automation Platform resource your automation controller instance will continue to use that original Postgres pod. If you were to do a fresh install you would have a single Postgres managed pod for all instances.
----

## Frequently asked questions on platform gateway

If I delete my Ansible Automation Platform deployment will I still have access to Automation Controller?:: No, automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible are nested within the deployment and are also deleted.
Something went wrong with my deployment but I'm not sure what, how can I find out?:: You can follow along in the command line while the operator is reconciling, this can be helpful for debugging.
Alternatively you can click into the deployment instance to see the status conditions being updated as the deployment goes on.
Is it still possible to view individual component logs?:: When troubleshooting you should examine the Ansible Automation Platform instance for the main logs and then each individual component (EDA, AutomationHub, AutomationController) for more specific information.
Where can I view the condition of an instance?:: To display status conditions click into the instance, and look under the Details or Events tab.
Alternatively, to display the status conditions you can run the get command:
oc get automationcontroller <instance-name> -o jsonpath=Pipe "| jq"
Can I track my migration in real time?:: To help track the status of the migration or to understand why migration might have failed you can look at the migration logs as they are running. Use the logs command:
oc logs fresh-install-controller-migration-4.6.0-jwfm6 -f

# Configuring automation controller on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can use these instructions to configure the automation controller operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, specify custom resources, and deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database.

Automation controller configuration can be done through the automation controller extra_settings or directly in the user interface after deployment. However, it is important to note that configurations made in extra_settings take precedence over settings made in the user interface.


[NOTE]
----
When an instance of automation controller is removed, the associated PVCs are not automatically deleted. This can cause issues during migration if the new deployment has the same name as the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you manually remove old PVCs before deploying a new automation controller instance in the same namespace. See Finding and deleting PVCs for more information.
----

## Prerequisites

* You have installed the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform catalog in Operator Hub.
* For automation controller, a default StorageClass must be configured on the cluster for the operator to dynamically create needed PVCs. This is not necessary if an external PostgreSQL database is configured.
* For Hub a StorageClass that supports ReadWriteMany must be available on the cluster to dynamically created the PVC needed for the content, redis and api pods. If it is not the default StorageClass on the cluster, you can specify it when creating your AutomationHub object.

You can view the progress by navigating to  and locating the newly created instance.

Verify that the following operator pods provided by the Ansible Automation Platform Operator installation from automation controller are running:




[NOTE]
----
A missing pod can indicate the need for a pull secret. Pull secrets are required for protected or private image registries. See Using image pull secrets for more information. You can diagnose this issue further by running oc describe pod <pod-name> to see if there is an ImagePullBackOff error on that pod.
----

## Configuring an external database for automation controller on Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator

For users who prefer to deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database, they can do so by configuring a secret with instance credentials and connection information, then applying it to their cluster using the oc create command.

By default, the Ansible Automation Platform Operator automatically creates and configures a managed PostgreSQL pod in the same namespace as your Ansible Automation Platform deployment. You can deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database instead of the managed PostgreSQL pod that the Ansible Automation Platform Operator automatically creates.

Using an external database lets you share and reuse resources and manually manage backups, upgrades, and performance optimizations.


[NOTE]
----
The same external database (PostgreSQL instance) can be used for both automation hub and automation controller as long as the database names are different. In other words, you can have multiple databases with different names inside a single PostgreSQL instance.
----

The following section outlines the steps to configure an external database for your automation controller on a Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

The external database must be a PostgreSQL database that is the version supported by the current release of Ansible Automation Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 supports PostgreSQL 15.
----

The external postgres instance credentials and connection information must be stored in a secret, which is then set on the automation controller spec.

1. Create a postgres_configuration_secret YAML file, following the template below:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-postgres-configuration
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
stringData:
  host: "<external_ip_or_url_resolvable_by_the_cluster>" 2
  port: "<external_port>" 3
  database: "<desired_database_name>"
  username: "<username_to_connect_as>"
  password: "<password_to_connect_with>" 4
  sslmode: "prefer" 5
  type: "unmanaged"
type: Opaque
```

Namespace to create the secret in. This should be the same namespace you want to deploy to.
The resolvable hostname for your database node.
External port defaults to 5432.
Value for variable password should not contain single or double quotes (', ") or backslashes (\) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.
The variable sslmode is valid for external databases only. The allowed values are: prefer, disable, allow, require, verify-ca, and verify-full.
2. Apply external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml to your cluster using the oc create command.

```
$ oc create -f external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml
```

3. When creating your AutomationController custom resource object, specify the secret on your spec, following the example below:

```
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: controller-dev
spec:
  postgres_configuration_secret: external-postgres-configuration
```


## Finding and deleting PVCs

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a storage volume used to store data that automation hub and automation controller applications use. These PVCs are independent from the applications and remain even when the application is deleted. If you are confident that you no longer need a PVC, or have backed it up elsewhere, you can manually delete them.

1. List the existing PVCs in your deployment namespace:

```
oc get pvc -n <namespace>
```

2. Identify the PVC associated with your previous deployment by comparing the old deployment name and the PVC name.
3. Delete the old PVC:

```
oc delete pvc -n <namespace> <pvc-name>
```

# Configuring automation hub on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console

You can use these instructions to configure the automation hub operator on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, specify custom resources, and deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database.

Automation hub configuration can be done through the automation hub pulp_settings or directly in the user interface after deployment. However, it is important to note that configurations made in pulp_settings take precedence over settings made in the user interface. Hub settings should always be set as lowercase on the Hub custom resource specification.


[NOTE]
----
When an instance of automation hub is removed, the PVCs are not automatically deleted. This can cause issues during migration if the new deployment has the same name as the previous one. Therefore, it is recommended that you manually remove old PVCs before deploying a new automation hub instance in the same namespace. See Finding and deleting PVCs for more information.
----

## Prerequisites

* You have installed the Ansible Automation Platform Operator in Operator Hub.

### Storage options for Ansible Automation Platform Operator installation on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Automation hub requires ReadWriteMany file-based storage, Azure Blob storage, or Amazon S3-compliant storage for operation so that multiple pods can access shared content, such as collections.

The process for configuring object storage on the AutomationHub CR is similar for Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage.

If you are using file-based storage and your installation scenario includes automation hub, ensure that the storage option for Ansible Automation Platform Operator is set to ReadWriteMany.
ReadWriteMany is the default storage option.

In addition, OpenShift Data Foundation provides a ReadWriteMany or S3-compliant implementation. Also, you can set up NFS storage configuration to support ReadWriteMany. This, however, introduces the NFS server as a potential, single point of failure.

* Persistent storage using NFS in the OpenShift Container Platform Storage guide
* IBM's How do I create a storage class for NFS dynamic storage provisioning in an OpenShift environment?

#### Provisioning OCP storage with ReadWriteMany access mode

To ensure successful installation of Ansible Automation Platform Operator, you must provision your storage type for automation hub initially to ReadWriteMany access mode.

1. Go to .
2. Click btn: Create PersistentVolume.
3. In the first step, update the accessModes from the default ReadWriteOnce to ReadWriteMany.
1. See Provisioning to update the access mode. for a detailed overview.
4. Complete the additional steps in this section to create the persistent volume claim (PVC).

#### Configuring object storage on Amazon S3

Red Hat supports Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for automation hub.
You can configure it when deploying the AutomationHub custom resource (CR), or you can configure it for an existing instance.

* Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the objects.
* Note the name of the S3 bucket.

1. Create a Kubernetes secret containing the AWS credentials and connection details, and the name of your Amazon S3 bucket.
The following example creates a secret called test-s3:

```yaml
$ oc -n $HUB_NAMESPACE apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: 'test-s3'
stringData:
  s3-access-key-id: $S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  s3-secret-access-key: $S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  s3-bucket-name: $S3_BUCKET_NAME
  s3-region: $S3_REGION
EOF
```

2. Add the secret to the automation hub custom resource (CR) spec:

```yaml
spec:
  object_storage_s3_secret: test-s3
```

3. If you are applying this secret to an existing instance, restart the API pods for the change to take effect.
<hub-name> is the name of your hub instance.


```bash
$ oc -n $HUB_NAMESPACE delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=<hub-name>-api
```


#### Configuring object storage on Azure Blob

Red Hat supports Azure Blob Storage for automation hub.
You can configure it when deploying the AutomationHub custom resource (CR), or you can configure it for an existing instance.

* Create an Azure Storage blob container to store the objects.
* Note the name of the blob container.

1. Create a Kubernetes secret containing the credentials and connection details for your Azure account, and the name of your Azure Storage blob container.
The following example creates a secret called test-azure:

```yaml
$ oc -n $HUB_NAMESPACE apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: 'test-azure'
stringData:
  azure-account-name: $AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME
  azure-account-key: $AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY
  azure-container: $AZURE_CONTAINER
  azure-container-path: $AZURE_CONTAINER_PATH
  azure-connection-string: $AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING
EOF
```

2. Add the secret to the automation hub custom resource (CR) spec:

```yaml
spec:
  object_storage_azure_secret: test-azure
```

3. If you are applying this secret to an existing instance, restart the API pods for the change to take effect.
<hub-name> is the name of your hub instance.


```bash
$ oc -n $HUB_NAMESPACE delete pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=<hub-name>-api
```

## Configuring LDAP authentication for Ansible automation hub on OpenShift Container Platform

Configure LDAP authentication settings for Ansible Automation Platform on OpenShift Container Platform in the spec section of your Hub instance configuration file.

* Use the following example to configure LDAP in your automation hub instance. For any blank fields, enter ``.

```
spec:
    pulp_settings:
      auth_ldap_user_attr_map:
        email: "mail"
        first_name: "givenName"
        last_name: "sn"
      auth_ldap_group_search_base_dn: 'cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com'
      auth_ldap_bind_dn: ' '
      auth_ldap_bind_password: ' '
      auth_ldap_group_search_filter: (objectClass=posixGroup)
      auth_ldap_user_search_scope: SUBTREE
      auth_ldap_server_uri: 'ldap://ldapserver:389'
      authentication_backend_preset: ldap
      auth_ldap_mirror_groups: 'True'
      auth_ldap_user_search_base_dn: 'cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com'
      auth_ldap_bind_password: 'ldappassword'
      auth_ldap_user_search_filter: (uid=%(user)s)
      auth_ldap_group_search_scope: SUBTREE
      auth_ldap_user_flags_by_group: '@json {"is_superuser": "cn=tower-admin,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com"}'
```



[NOTE]
----
Do not leave any fields empty. For fields with no variable, enter `` to indicate a default value.

## Finding the automation hub route

You can access the automation hub through the platform gateway or through the following procedure.

1. Log into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to .
3. Under Location, click on the URL for your automation hub instance.

The automation hub user interface launches where you can sign in with the administrator credentials specified during the operator configuration process.


[NOTE]
----
If you did not specify an administrator password during configuration, one was automatically created for you. To locate this password, go to your project, select  and open controller-admin-password. From there you can copy the password and paste it into the Automation hub password field.
----

## Configuring an external database for automation hub on Ansible Automation Platform Operator

For users who prefer to deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database, they can do so by configuring a secret with instance credentials and connection information, then applying it to their cluster using the oc create command.

By default, the Ansible Automation Platform Operator automatically creates and configures a managed PostgreSQL pod in the same namespace as your Ansible Automation Platform deployment.

You can choose to use an external database instead if you prefer to use a dedicated node to ensure dedicated resources or to manually manage backups, upgrades, or performance tweaks.


[NOTE]
----
The same external database (PostgreSQL instance) can be used for both automation hub and automation controller as long as the database names are different. In other words, you can have multiple databases with different names inside a single PostgreSQL instance.
----

The following section outlines the steps to configure an external database for your automation hub on a Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

The external database must be a PostgreSQL database that is the version supported by the current release of Ansible Automation Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 supports PostgreSQL 15.
----

The external postgres instance credentials and connection information will need to be stored in a secret, which will then be set on the automation hub spec.

1. Create a postgres_configuration_secret YAML file, following the template below:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-postgres-configuration
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
stringData:
  host: "<external_ip_or_url_resolvable_by_the_cluster>" 2
  port: "<external_port>" 3
  database: "<desired_database_name>"
  username: "<username_to_connect_as>"
  password: "<password_to_connect_with>" 4
  sslmode: "prefer" 5
  type: "unmanaged"
type: Opaque
```

Namespace to create the secret in. This should be the same namespace you want to deploy to.
The resolvable hostname for your database node.
External port defaults to 5432.
Value for variable password should not contain single or double quotes (', ") or backslashes (\) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.
The variable sslmode is valid for external databases only. The allowed values are: prefer, disable, allow, require, verify-ca, and verify-full.
2. Apply external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml to your cluster using the oc create command.

```
$ oc create -f external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml
```

3. When creating your AutomationHub custom resource object, specify the secret on your spec, following the example below:

```
apiVersion: automationhub.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationHub
metadata:
  name: hub-dev
spec:
  postgres_configuration_secret: external-postgres-configuration
```


### Enabling the hstore extension for the automation hub PostgreSQL database

Added in Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, the database migration script uses hstore fields to store information, therefore the hstore extension to the automation hub PostgreSQL database must be enabled.

This process is automatic when using the Ansible Automation Platform installer and a managed PostgreSQL server.

If the PostgreSQL database is external, you must enable the hstore extension to the automation hub PostreSQL database manually before automation hub installation.

If the hstore extension is not enabled before automation hub installation, a failure is raised during database migration.

1. Check if the extension is available on the PostgreSQL server (automation hub database).

```
$ psql -d <automation hub database> -c "SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name='hstore'"
```


Where the default value for <automation hub database> is automationhub.

Example output with hstore available:

```
name  | default_version | installed_version |comment
------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------
 hstore | 1.7           |                   | data type for storing sets of (key, value) pairs
(1 row)
```


Example output with hstore not available:

```
 name | default_version | installed_version | comment
------+-----------------+-------------------+---------
(0 rows)
```

2. On a RHEL based server, the hstore extension is included in the postgresql-contrib RPM package, which is not installed automatically when installing the PostgreSQL server RPM package.

To install the RPM package, use the following command:

```
dnf install postgresql-contrib
```

3. Create the hstore PostgreSQL extension on the automation hub database with the following command:

```
$ psql -d <automation hub database> -c "CREATE EXTENSION hstore;"
```


The output of which is:

```
CREATE EXTENSION
```

4. In the following output, the installed_version field contains the hstore extension used, indicating that hstore is enabled.

```
name | default_version | installed_version | comment
-----+-----------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------
hstore  |     1.7      |       1.7         | data type for storing sets of (key, value) pairs
(1 row)
```


## Finding and deleting PVCs

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a storage volume used to store data that automation hub and automation controller applications use. These PVCs are independent from the applications and remain even when the application is deleted. If you are confident that you no longer need a PVC, or have backed it up elsewhere, you can manually delete them.

1. List the existing PVCs in your deployment namespace:

```
oc get pvc -n <namespace>
```

2. Identify the PVC associated with your previous deployment by comparing the old deployment name and the PVC name.
3. Delete the old PVC:

```
oc delete pvc -n <namespace> <pvc-name>
```


## Additional configurations

A collection download count can help you understand collection usage. To add a collection download count to automation hub, set the following configuration:


```
spec:
  pulp_settings:
    ansible_collect_download_count: true
```


When ansible_collect_download_count is enabled, automation hub will display a download count by the collection.

## Additional resources

# Using Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator with automation hub

Private automation hub uses Red Hat Single Sign-On for authentication.

The Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator creates and manages resources.
Use this operator to create custom resources to automate Red Hat Single Sign-On administration in OpenShift.

* When installing Ansible Automation Platform on Virtual Machines (VMs) the installer can automatically install and configure Red Hat Single Sign-On for use with private automation hub.
* When installing Ansible Automation Platform on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform you must install Single Sign-On separately.

This chapter describes the process to configure Red Hat Single Sign-On and integrate it with private automation hub when Ansible Automation Platform is installed on OpenShift Container Platform.

* You have access to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform using an account with operator installation permissions.
* You have installed the catalog containing the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operators.
* You have installed the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator.
To install the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator, follow the procedure in Installing Red Hat Single Sign-On using a custom resource in the Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation.

## Creating a Keycloak instance

After you install the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator, you can create a Keycloak instance for use with Ansible Automation Platform.

From here you provide an external Postgres or one will be created for you.

metadata:
  name: example-keycloak
  labels:
	app: sso
  namespace: aap
spec:
  externalAccess:
	enabled: true
  instances: 1
```


+
. Click Create.

1. When deployment is complete, you can use this credential to login to the administrative console.
2. You can find the credentials for the administrator in the credential-<custom-resource> (example keycloak) secret in the namespace.

## Creating a Keycloak realm for Ansible Automation Platform

Create a realm to manage a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups.

    realm: ansible-automation-platform
    enabled: true
    displayName: Ansible Automation Platform
  instanceSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sso
```


6. Click Create and wait for the process to complete.

## Creating a Keycloak client

Keycloak clients authenticate hub users with Red Hat Single Sign-On.
When a user authenticates the request goes through the Keycloak client.
When Single Sign-On validates or issues the OAuth token, the client provides the response to automation hub and the user can log in.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to .
3. Select the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator project.
4. Select the Keycloak Client tab and click Create Keycloak Client.
5. On the Keycloak Realm form, select YAML view.

  roles:
    - name: "hubadmin"
      description: "An administrator role for automation hub"
```

Replace this with a unique value.
7. Click Create and wait for the process to complete.

After you deploy automation hub, you must update the client with the “Valid Redirect URIs” and “Web Origins” as described in Updating the Red Hat Single Sign-On client
Additionally, the client comes pre-configured with token mappers, however, if your authentication provider does not provide group data to Red Hat SSO, then the group mapping must be updated to reflect how that information is passed.
This is commonly by user attribute.

## Creating a Keycloak user

This procedure creates a Keycloak user, with the hubadmin role, that can log in to automation hub with Super Administration privileges.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to .
3. Select the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator project.
4. Select the Keycloak Realm tab and click Create Keycloak User.
5. On the Keycloak User form, select YAML view.
6. Replace the default YAML file with the following:

```
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: KeycloakUser
metadata:
  name: hubadmin-user
  labels:
    app: sso
    realm: ansible-automation-platform
  namespace: rh-sso
spec:
  realmSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sso
      realm: ansible-automation-platform
  user:
    username: hub_admin
    firstName: Hub
    lastName: Admin
    email: hub_admin@example.com
    enabled: true
    emailVerified: false
    credentials:
      - type: password
        value: <ch8ngeme>
    clientRoles:
      automation-hub:
        - hubadmin
```

7. Click Create and wait for the process to complete.

When a user is created, the Operator creates a Secret containing both the username and password using the following naming pattern: credential-<realm name>-<username>-<namespace>.
In this example the credential is called credential-ansible-automation-platform-hub-admin-rh-sso.
When a user is created the Operator does not update the user&#8217;s password.
Password changes are not reflected in the Secret.

3. Select the project you used for the install.
4. Copy the location of the private-ah-web-svc service.
The name of the service is different if you used a different name when creating the automation hub instance.
This is used later to update the Red Hat Single Sign-On client.

## Updating the Red Hat Single Sign-On client

After you install automation hub and you know the URL of the instance, you must update the Red Hat Single Sign-On to set the Valid Redirect URIs and Web Origins settings.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to .
3. Select the RH-SSO project.
4. Click Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator.
5. Select Keycloak Client.
6. Click on the automation-hub-client-secret client.
7. Select YAML.
8. Update the Client YAML to add the Valid Redirect URIs and Web Origins settings.

```
redirectUris:
  - 'https://private-ah-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing/*'
webOrigins:
  - 'https://private-ah-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing'
```



[NOTE]
----
Ensure the indentation is correct when entering these settings.
----
9. Click Save.

1. Navigate to the automation hub route.
2. Enter the hub_admin user credentials and sign in.
3. Red Hat Single Sign-On processes the authentication and redirects back to automation hub.

# Adding execution nodes to Ansible Automation Platform Operator

You can enable the Ansible Automation Platform Operator with execution nodes by downloading and installing the install bundle.

* An automation controller instance.
* The receptor collection package is installed.
* AAP Repository ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-{RHEL-RELEASE-NUMBER}-x86_64-rpms is enabled.

1. Log in to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.
2. In the navigation panel, select .
3. Click Add.
4. Input the Execution Node domain name or IP in the Host Name field.
5. Optional: Input the port number in the Listener Port field.
6. Click Save.
7. Click the download icon next to Install Bundle. This starts a download, take note of where you save the file
8. Untar the gz file.

[NOTE]
----
To run the install_receptor.yml playbook you need to install  the receptor collection from Ansible Galaxy:
Ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----
9. Update the playbook with your user name and SSH private key file. Note that ansible_host pre-populates with the hostname you input earlier.

```
all:
   hosts:
      remote-execution:
	        ansible_host: example_host_name # Same with configured in AAP WebUI
	        ansible_user: <username> #user provided
	        Ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_example
```

10. Open your terminal, and navigate to the directory where you saved the playbook.
11. To install the bundle run:

```
ansible-playbook install_receptor.yml -i inventory.yml
```

12. When installed you can now upgrade your execution node by downloading and re-running the playbook for the instance you created.

To verify receptor service status run the following command:


```
sudo systemctl status receptor.service
```


Make sure the service is in active (running) state

To verify if your playbook runs correctly on your new node run the following command:


```
watch podman ps
```

# Ansible Automation Platform Resource Operator

## Resource Operator overview

Resource Operator is a custom resource (CR) that you can deploy after you have created your platform gateway deployment.
 With Resource Operator you can define projects, job templates, and inventories through the use of YAML files.
 These YAML files are then used by automation controller to create these resources.
 You can create the YAML through the Form view that prompts you for keys and values for your YAML code.
 Alternatively, to work with YAML directly, you can select YAML view.

There are currently two custom resources provided by the Resource Operator:

* AnsibleJob: launches a job in the automation controller instance specified in the Kubernetes secret (automation controller host URL, token).
* JobTemplate: creates a job template in the automation controller instance specified.

## Using Resource Operator

The Resource Operator itself does not do anything until the user creates an object.
As soon as the user creates an AutomationControllerProject or AnsibleJob resource, the Resource Operator will start processing that object.

* Install the Kubernetes-based cluster of your choice.
* Deploy automation controller using the automation-controller-operator.

After installing the automation-controller-resource-operator in your cluster, you must create a Kubernetes (k8s) secret with the connection information for your automation controller instance.
Then you can use Resource Operator to create a k8s resource to manage your automation controller instance.

## Connecting Resource Operator to platform gateway

To connect Resource Operator with platform gateway you need to create a k8s secret with the connection information for your automation controller instance.


[NOTE]
----
You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your own user through the API or UI, which means you can only configure or view tokens from your own user profile.
----

To create an OAuth2 token for your user in the platform gateway UI:

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. In the navigation panel, select .
3. Select the username you want to create a token for.
4. Select
5. Click Create Token.
6. You can leave Applications empty. Add a description and select Read or Write for the Scope.


[NOTE]
----
Make sure you provide a valid user when creating tokens.
Otherwise, you will get an error message that you tried to issue the command without specifying a user, or supplying a username that does not exist.
----

## Creating a automation controller connection secret for Resource Operator

To make your connection information available to the Resource Operator, create a k8s secret with the token and host value.

1. The following is an example of the YAML for the connection secret.
Save the following example to a file, for example, automation-controller-connection-secret.yml.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: controller-access
  type: Opaque
stringData:
  token: <generated-token>
  host: https://my-controller-host.example.com/
```

2. Edit the file with your host and token value.
3. Apply it to your cluster by running the kubectl create command:


```
kubectl create -f controller-connection-secret.yml
```


## Creating an AnsibleJob

Launch an automation job on automation controller by creating an AnsibleJob resource.

1. Specify the connection secret and job template you want to launch.

```
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  generateName: demo-job-1 # generate a unique suffix per 'kubectl create'
spec:
  connection_secret: controller-access
  job_template_name: Demo Job Template
```

2. Configure features such as, inventory, extra variables, and time to live for the job.

```
spec:
  connection_secret: controller-access
  job_template_name: Demo Job Template
  inventory: Demo Inventory                    # Inventory prompt on launch needs to be enabled
  runner_image: quay.io/ansible/controller-resource-runner
  runner_version: latest
  job_ttl: 100
  extra_vars:                                  # Extra variables prompt on launch needs to be enabled
     test_var: test
  job_tags: "provision,install,configuration"  # Specify tags to run
  skip_tags: "configuration,restart"           # Skip tasks with a given tag
```


[NOTE]
----
You must enable  prompt on launch for inventories and extra variables if you are configuring those. To enable Prompt on launch, within the automation controller UI:
From the  page, select your template and select the Prompt on launch checkbox next to Inventory and Variables sections.
----
3. Launch a workflow job template with an AnsibleJob object by specifying the workflow_template_name instead of job_template_name:

```
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: AnsibleJob
metadata:
  generateName: demo-job-1 # generate a unique suffix per 'kubectl create'
spec:
  connection_secret: controller-access
  workflow_template_name: Demo Workflow Template
```


## Creating a JobTemplate

* Create a job template on automation controller by creating a JobTemplate resource:

```
apiVersion: tower.ansible.com/v1alpha1
kind: JobTemplate
metadata:
  name: jobtemplate-4
spec:
  connection_secret: controller-access
  job_template_name: ExampleJobTemplate4
  job_template_project: Demo Project
  job_template_playbook: hello_world.yml
  job_template_inventory: Demo Inventory
```
