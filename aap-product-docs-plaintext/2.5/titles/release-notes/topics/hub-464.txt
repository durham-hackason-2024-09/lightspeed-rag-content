# Automation hub

Automation hub enables you to discover and use new certified automation content, such as Ansible Collections, from Red Hat Ansible and Certified Partners.

* This release of automation hub provides repository management functionality. With repository management, you can create, edit, delete, and move content between repositories.

* Fixed an issue in the collection keyword search which was returning an incorrect number of results.
* Added the ability to set OPT_REFERRALS option for LDAP, so that users can now successfully log in to the automation hub by using their LDAP credentials.
* Fixed an error on the UI when redhat.openshift collection's core dependency was throwing a 404 Not Found error.
* Fixed an error such that the deprecated execution environments are now skipped while syncing with registry.redhat.io.
