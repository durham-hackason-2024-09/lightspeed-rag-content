# System Requirements

There are several minimum requirements to install and run Ansible Automation Platform Central Authentication:

* Any operating system that runs Java
* Java 8 JDK
* zip or gzip and tar
* At least 512mb of RAM
* At least 1gb of disk space
* A shared external database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc. if you want to run central authentication in a cluster.
See the Database Configuration section of the Red Hat Single Sign-On Server Installation and Configuration guide for more information.
* Network multicast support on your machine if you want to run in a cluster. central authentication can be clustered without multicast, but this requires some configuration changes.
See the Clustering section of the Red Hat Single Sign-On Server Installation and Configuration guide for more information.
* On Linux, it is recommended to use /dev/urandom as a source of random data to prevent central authentication hanging due to lack of available entropy, unless /dev/random usage is mandated by your security policy. To achieve that on Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8, set the java.security.egd system property on startup to file:/dev/urandom.
