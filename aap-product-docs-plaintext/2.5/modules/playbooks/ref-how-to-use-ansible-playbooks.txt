# How do I use Ansible Playbooks?

Ansible uses the YAML syntax.
YAML is a human-readable language that enables you to create playbooks without having to learn a complicated coding language.
For more information on YAML, see YAML Syntax and consider installing an add-on for your text editor, see Other Tools and Programs to help you write clean YAML syntax in your playbooks.
There are two ways of using Ansible Playbooks:
* From the command line interface (CLI)
* Using Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform's push-button deployments.

# From the CLI

After installing the open source Ansible project or Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform by using


```
$ sudo dnf install ansible
```


in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CLI, you can use the ansible-playbook command to run Ansible Playbooks.

# From within the platform

The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform user interface offers push-button Ansible Playbook deployments that can be used as part of larger jobs or job templates.
These deployments come with additional safeguards that are particularly helpful to users who are newer to IT automation, or those without as much experience working in the CLI.
