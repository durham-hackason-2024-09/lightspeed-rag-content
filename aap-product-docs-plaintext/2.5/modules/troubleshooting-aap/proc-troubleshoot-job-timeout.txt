# Issue - Jobs are failing with “Timeout (12s) waiting for privilege escalation prompt” error message

This error can happen when the timeout value is too small, causing the job to stop before completion. The default timeout value for connection plugins is 10.

To resolve the issue, increase the timeout value by completing one of the following procedures.


[NOTE]
----
The following changes will affect all of the jobs in automation controller. To use a timeout value for a specific project, add an ansible.cfg file in the root of the project directory and add the timeout parameter value to that ansible.cfg file.
----

Add ANSIBLE_TIMEOUT as an environment variable in the automation controller UI

1. Go to automation controller.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Jobs settings].
3. Under Extra Environment Variables add the following:

```
{
"ANSIBLE_TIMEOUT": 60
}
```


Add a timeout value in the [defaults] section of the ansible.cfg file by using the CLI

* Edit the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file and add the following:

```
[defaults]
timeout = 60
```


Running ad hoc commands with a timeout

* To run an ad hoc playbook in the command line, add the --timeout flag to the ansible-playbook command, for example:

```
# ansible-playbook --timeout=60 <your_playbook.yml>
```


* For more information about the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT configuration setting, see DEFAULT_TIMEOUT in the Ansible Community Documentation.
