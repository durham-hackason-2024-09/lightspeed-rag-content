# Issue - Jobs in automation controller are stuck in a pending state

After launching jobs in automation controller, the jobs stay in a pending state and do not start.

There are a few reasons jobs can become stuck in a pending state. For more information about troubleshooting this issue, see Playbook stays in pending in the Automation Controller Administration Guide.

Cancel all pending jobs

1. Run the following commands to list all of the pending jobs:

```
# awx-manage shell_plus
```


```
>>> UnifiedJob.objects.filter(status='pending')
```

2. Run the following command to cancel all of the pending jobs:

```
>>> UnifiedJob.objects.filter(status='pending').update(status='canceled')
```


Cancel a single job by using a job id

* To cancel a specific job, run the following commands, replacing <job_id> with the job id to cancel:

```
# awx-manage shell_plus
```


```
>>> UnifiedJob.objects.filter(id=_<job_id>_).update(status='canceled')
```
