# About execution environments

Automation execution environments are consistent and shareable container images that serve as Ansible control nodes. Automation execution environments reduce the challenge of sharing Ansible content that has external dependencies.

Automation execution environments contain:

* Ansible Core
* Ansible Runner
* Ansible Collections
* Python libraries
* System dependencies
* Custom user needs

You can define and create an automation execution environment using Ansible Builder.

* For more information about Ansible Builder, see Creating and Consuming Execution Environments.
