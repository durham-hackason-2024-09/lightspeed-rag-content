# Installing Ansible Builder

* You have installed the Podman container runtime.
* You have valid subscriptions attached on the host. Doing so allows you to access the subscription-only resources needed to install ansible-builder, and ensures that the necessary repository for ansible-builder is automatically enabled. See Attaching your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription for more information.

* In your terminal, run the following command to install Ansible Builder and activate your Ansible Automation Platform repo:

```
#  dnf install --enablerepo=ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms ansible-builder
```
