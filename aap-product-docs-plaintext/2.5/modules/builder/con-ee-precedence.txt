# Automation execution environments precedence

Project updates will always use the control plane automation execution environments by default, however, jobs will use the first available automation execution environments as follows:

1. The execution_environment defined on the template (job template or inventory source) that created the job.
2. The default_environment defined on the project that the job uses.
3. The default_environment defined on the organization of the job.
4. The default_environment defined on the organization of the inventory the job uses.
5. The current DEFAULT_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT setting (configurable at api/v2/settings/system/)
6. Any image from the GLOBAL_JOB_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENTS setting.
7. Any other global execution environment.


[NOTE]
----
If more than one execution environment fits a criteria (applies for 6 and 7), the most recently created one is used.
