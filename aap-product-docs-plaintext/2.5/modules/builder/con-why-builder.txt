# Why use Ansible Builder?

Before Ansible Builder was developed, Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform users could run into dependency issues and errors when creating custom virtual environments or containers that included all of the required dependencies installed.

Now, with Ansible Builder, you can easily create a customizable automation execution environments definition file that specifies the content you want included in your automation execution environments such as Ansible Core, Python, Collections, third-party Python requirements, and system level packages. This allows you to fulfill all of the necessary requirements and dependencies to get jobs running.
