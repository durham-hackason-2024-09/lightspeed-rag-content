# About automation execution environments

All automation in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform runs on container images called automation execution environments.
Automation execution environments create a common language for communicating automation dependencies, and offer a standard way to build and distribute the automation environment.

An automation execution environment should contain the following:

* Ansible Core 2.15 or later
* Python 3.8-3.11
* Ansible Runner
* Ansible content collections and their dependencies
* System dependencies
