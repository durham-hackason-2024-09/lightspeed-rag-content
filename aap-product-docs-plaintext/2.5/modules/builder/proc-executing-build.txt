# Building the automation execution environment image

After you create a definition file, you can proceed to build an automation execution environment image.

* You have created a definition file.

To build an automation execution environment image, run the following from the command line:


```
$ ansible-builder build
```


By default, Ansible Builder looks for a definition file named execution-environment.yml but a different file path can be specified as an argument with the -f flag:


```
$ ansible-builder build -f definition-file-name.yml
```


where definition-file-name specifies the name of your definition file.
