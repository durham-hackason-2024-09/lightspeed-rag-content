# Creating a new IDPS rule

Use the ids_rule role to manage your rules and signatures for IDPS. For example, you can set a new rule that looks for a certain pattern aligning with a previous attack on your firewall.


[NOTE]
----
Currently, the ids_rule role only supports Snort IDPS.
----

* You need root privileges to make any changes on the Snort server.

1. Install the ids_rule role using the ansible-galaxy command:

```
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.ids_rule
```

2. Create a new playbook file titled add_snort_rule.yml. Set the following parameters:

```
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
```

3. Add the become flag to ensure that Ansible handles privilege escalation.

```
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: true
```

4. Specify the name of your IDPS provider by adding the following variables:

```
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: true

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort
```

5. Add the following tasks and task-specific variables (e.g., rules, Snort rules file, and the state of the rule - present or absent) to the playbook:

```
- name: Add Snort rule
  hosts: snort
  become: true

  vars:
    ids_provider: snort

  tasks:
    -  name: Add snort password attack rule
       include_role:
         name: "ansible_security.ids_rule"
       vars:
         ids_rule: 'alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Attempted /etc/passwd Attack"; uricontent:"/etc/passwd"; classtype:attempted-user; sid:99000004; priority:1; rev:1;)'
         ids_rules_file: '/etc/snort/rules/local.rules'
         ids_rule_state: present
```


Tasks are components that make changes on the target machine. Since you are using a role that defines these tasks, the include_role is the only entry you need.

The ids_rules_file variable specifies a defined location for the local.rules file, while the ids_rule_state variable indicates that the rule should be created if it does not already exist.
6. Run the playbook by executing the following command:

```
$ ansible-navigator run add_snort_rule.ym --mode stdout
```


Once you run the playbook, all of your tasks will be executed in addition to your newly created rules. Your playbook output will confirm your PLAY, TASK, RUNNING HANDLER, and PLAY RECAP.

To verify that your IDPS rules were successfully created, SSH to the Snort server and view the content of the /etc/snort/rules/local.rules file.
