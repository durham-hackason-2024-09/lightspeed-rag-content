# Deleting a firewall rule

Use the acl_manager role to delete a security rule.

* You have installed Ansible 2.9 or later
* You have access to the firewall MGMT servers to enforce the new policies

1. Install the acl_manager role using the ansible-galaxy command:

```
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.acl_manager
```

2. Using CLI, create a new playbook with the acl_manger role and set the parameters (e.g., source object, destination object, access rule between the two objects):

```
- name: delete block list entry
  hosts: checkpoint
  connection: httpapi

    - include_role:
        name: acl_manager
        Tasks_from: unblock_ip
      vars:
        source_ip: 192.168.0.10
        destination_ip: 192.168.0.11
        ansible_network_os: checkpoint
```

3. Run the playbook $ ansible-navigator run --ee false <playbook.yml>:
![Playbook with deleted firewall rule]

You have deleted the firewall rule. Access the MGMT server and verify that the new security policy has been removed.
