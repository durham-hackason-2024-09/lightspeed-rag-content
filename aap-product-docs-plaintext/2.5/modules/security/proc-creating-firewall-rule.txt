# Creating a new firewall rule

Use the acl_manager role to create a new firewall rule for blocking a source IP address from accessing a destination IP address.

* You have installed the latest version of ansible-core.
* You have access to the Check Point Management server to enforce the new policies

1. Install the acl_manager role using the ansible-galaxy command.

```
$ ansible-galaxy install ansible_security.acl_manager
```

2. Create a new playbook and set the following parameter. For example, source object, destination object, access rule between the two objects and the actual firewall you are managing, such as Check Point:

```
- name: block IP address
  hosts: checkpoint
  connection: httpapi

  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: acl_manager
        tasks_from: block_ip
      vars:
        source_ip: 172.17.13.98
        destination_ip: 192.168.0.10
        ansible_network_os: checkpoint
```

3. Run the playbook $ ansible-navigator run --ee false <playbook.yml>.

You have created a new firewall rule that blocks a source IP address from accessing a destination IP address. Access the MGMT server and verify that the new security policy has been created.
