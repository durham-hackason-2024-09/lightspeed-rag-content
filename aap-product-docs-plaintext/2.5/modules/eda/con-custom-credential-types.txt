# Custom credential types

As a system administrator, you can define a custom credential type that works in ways similar to existing credential types in a standard format using a YAML or JSON-like definition.

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration field and the Injector Configuration field, if applicable. Custom credentials support Ansible extra variables as a means of injecting their authentication information.

You can attach one or more cloud, vault, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform credentials to a rulebook activation.


[NOTE]
----
* When creating a new credential type, you must avoid collisions in the extra_vars.
* Extra variable names must not start with EDA_ because they are reserved.
* You must have System administrator (superuser) permissions to be able to create and edit a credential type and to be able to view the Injector configuration field.
----

When you customize your own credential types, they will display on the Credential Types page along with a list of built-in credential types.

Each credential type displays its own unique configurations in the Input Configuration and the Injector Configuration fields, if applicable. Both YAML and JSON formats are supported in the configuration fields.

## Input Configuration

The Input configuration has two attributes:

* fields - a collection of properties for a credential type.
* required - a list of required fields.

Fields can have multiple properties, depending on the credential type you select.



## Injector Configuration

You can use the Injector configuration field to take the fields from input configuration field and map them into extra_vars that can be sent to ansible-rulebook when running the activation. The Injector currently only supports extra_vars.

Injectors enable you to tailor the fields so that they can be injected into a rulebook as extra_vars, which cannot have duplicate keys at the top level. If you have two sources in a rulebook that both require a parameter called username and password, the injectors, along with the rulebook, help you tailor the arguments for each source.
