# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations after Event-Driven Ansible controller installation

By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 activations to run simultaneously.
You can modify this default value after installation by using the following procedure:

1. Navigate to the environment file at /etc/ansible-automation-platform/eda/settings.yaml.
2. Choose the number of maximum running activations that you need.
For example, MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS = 16
3. Use the following command to restart Event-Driven Ansible services: automation-eda-controller-service restart
