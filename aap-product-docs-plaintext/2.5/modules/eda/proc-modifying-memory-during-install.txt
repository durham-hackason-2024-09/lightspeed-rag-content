# Modifying the default memory limit for each rulebook activation during installation

By default, each rulebook activation container has a 200MB memory limit.
You can modify this default value during installation by using the following procedure:

1. Navigate to the setup inventory file.
2. Add automationedacontroller_podman_mem_limit in the [all:vars] section.
For example, automationedacontroller_podman_mem_limit='400m'.
3. Run the setup.
