# Performance Troubleshooting for Event-Driven Ansible controller

Based on the default parameters within Event-Driven Ansible controller, you might encounter scenarios that pose challenges to completing your workload.
The following section provides descriptions of these scenarios and troubleshooting guidance.

* My activation status displays as “running”, but it is not processing the events.
* Ensure that you are using the correct event source in the rulebook activation.
If the event you are expecting is coming from a source other than what is in the rulebook, Event-Driven Ansible controller will not process the event.
* My activation status displays as “running”, and Event-Driven Ansible controller is also receiving the events, but no actions are occuring.
* Ensure that you have set the correct conditions for matching the event and taking actions in the rulebook activation.
* My activation keeps restarting in an infinite loop.
* By default, the reset policy for rulebook activations is set to On Failure. Change the restart policy using the following procedure:
1. Navigate to menu:Automation Decisions[Rulebook Activations].
2. Select the Restart Policy list to display the options.
3. Select the appropriate value: On Failure, Always, Never.
