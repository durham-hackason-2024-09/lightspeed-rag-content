# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during Event-Driven Ansible controller installation

By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 activations to run simultaneously.
You can modify this default value during installation by using the following procedure:

Provide a variable to the VM installer:

1. Navigate to the setup inventory file.
2. Add automationedacontroller_max_running_activations in the [all:vars] section.
For example, automationedacontroller_max_running_activations=16.
3. Run the setup.
