# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations

By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 rulebook activations to run simultaneously.
If more than 12 rulebook activations are created, the expected behavior is that subsequent rulebook activations wait until there is an available rulebook activation worker.
In this case, the rulebook activation status is displayed as Pending even if there is enough free memory and CPU on your Event-Driven Ansible controller instance.
To change this behavior, you must change the default maximum number of running rulebook activations.

[NOTE]
----
The value for MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS does not change when you modify the instance size, so it needs to be adjusted manually.

# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations during Event-Driven Ansible controller installation

By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 activations to run simultaneously.
You can modify this default value during installation by using the following procedure:

Provide a variable to the VM installer:

1. Navigate to the setup inventory file.
2. Add automationedacontroller_max_running_activations in the [all:vars] section.
For example, automationedacontroller_max_running_activations=16.
3. Run the setup.

# Modifying the number of simultaneous rulebook activations after Event-Driven Ansible controller installation

By default, Event-Driven Ansible controller allows 12 activations to run simultaneously.
You can modify this default value after installation by using the following procedure:

1. Navigate to the environment file at /etc/ansible-automation-platform/eda/settings.yaml.
2. Choose the number of maximum running activations that you need.
For example, MAX_RUNNING_ACTIVATIONS = 16
3. Use the following command to restart Event-Driven Ansible services: automation-eda-controller-service restart
