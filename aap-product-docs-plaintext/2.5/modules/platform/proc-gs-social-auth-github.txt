# Configuring GitHub authentication

You can connect GitHub identities to Ansible Automation Platform using OAuth.
To set up GitHub authentication, you need to obtain an OAuth2 key and secret by registering your organization-owned application from GitHub using the Installing your own GitHub App.

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.
To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration.
For more information about accessing this, see Displaying authenticator details.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Authentication Methods].
2. Click btn:[Create authentication].
3. Select GitHub from the Authentication type list.
4. Enter a Name for this authentication setting.
5. When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret:
* Copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the GitHub OAuth2 Key field.
* Copy and paste the GitHub Client Secret into the GitHub OAuth2 Secret field.
6. Optional: Enter any Additional Authenticator Fields that this authenticator can take.
These fields are not validated and are passed directly back to the authenticator.

[NOTE]

Values defined in this field override the dedicated fields provided in the UI.
