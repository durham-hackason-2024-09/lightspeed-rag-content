The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See Displaying authenticator details for instructions on accessing this information.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Authentication Methods].
2. Click btn:[Create authentication].
3. Select GitHub from the Authentication type list and click btn:[Next].
4. Enter a Name for this authentication configuration.
5. When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret:
1. Copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the GitHub OAuth2 Key field.

8. To enable this authentication method upon creation, select Enabled.
