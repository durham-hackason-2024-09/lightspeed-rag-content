# Using Resource Operator

The Resource Operator itself does not do anything until the user creates an object.
As soon as the user creates an AutomationControllerProject or AnsibleJob resource, the Resource Operator will start processing that object.

* Install the Kubernetes-based cluster of your choice.
* Deploy automation controller using the automation-controller-operator.

After installing the automation-controller-resource-operator in your cluster, you must create a Kubernetes (k8s) secret with the connection information for your automation controller instance.
Then you can use Resource Operator to create a k8s resource to manage your automation controller instance.
