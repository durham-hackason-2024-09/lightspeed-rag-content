# Content sourcing from collections

A "managed" credential type of kind=galaxy represents a content source for fetching collections defined in requirements.yml when project
updates are run.
Examples of content sources are galaxy.ansible.com, console.redhat.com, or on-premise automation hub.
This new credential type represents a URL and (optional) authentication details necessary to construct the environment variables when a project update runs ansible-galaxy collection install as described in the Ansible documentation, Configuring the ansible-galaxy client.
It has fields that map directly to the configuration options exposed to the Ansible Galaxy CLI, for example, per-server.

An endpoint in the API reflects an ordered list of these credentials at the Organization level:

/api/v2/organizations/N/galaxy_credentials/

When installations of automation controller migrate existing Galaxy-oriented setting values, post-upgrade proper credentials are created and
attached to every Organization.
After upgrading to the latest version, every organization that existed before upgrade now has a list of one or more "Galaxy" credentials associated with it.

Additionally, post-upgrade, these settings are not visible (or editable) from the /api/v2/settings/jobs/ endpoint.

Automation controller continues to fetch roles directly from public Galaxy even if galaxy.ansible.com is not the first credential in the list for the organization. The global Galaxy settings are no longer configured at the jobs level, but at the organization level in the user interface.

The organization&#8217;s Add and Edit windows have an optional Credential lookup field for credentials of kind=galaxy.



It is important to specify the order of these credentials as order sets precedence for the sync and lookup of the content.
