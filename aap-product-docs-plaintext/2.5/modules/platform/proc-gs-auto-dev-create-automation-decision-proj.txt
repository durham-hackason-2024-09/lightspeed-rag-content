# Creating an automation decision project

Like automation execution projects, automation decision projects are logical collections of automation decision content.
You can use the project function to organize your automation decision content in a way that makes sense to you.

* You are logged in to the Event-Driven Ansible controller Dashboard as a Content Consumer.
* You have set up a credential, if necessary.
For more information, see the [ADD 2.5 LINK][Setting up credentials] section.
* You have an existing repository containing rulebooks that are integrated with playbooks contained in a repository to be used by automation controller.

1. Log in to the Event-Driven Ansible controller Dashboard.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Decisions[Projects].
3. Insert the following:
Name:: Enter project name.
Description:: This field is optional.
SCM type:: Git is the only SCM type available for use.
SCM URL:: HTTP[S] protocol address of a repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.

[NOTE]
----
You cannot edit the SCM URL after you create the project.
----
Credential:: This field is optional. This is the token needed to use the SCM URL.
4. Select btn:[Create project].

Your project is now created and can be managed in the Projects screen.

After saving the new project, the project&#8217;s details page is displayed.
From there or the Projects list view, you can edit or delete it.
