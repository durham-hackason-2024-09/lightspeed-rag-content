# Setting registry_username and registry_password

If you intend to use the registry_username and registry_password variables in an inventory file you are recommended to use the following method to create a Registry Service Account to set a token with an expiration in the plaintext inventory/vars.yml file instead of using a plaintext username and password, for reasons of security.

Registry service accounts provide named tokens that can be used in environments where credentials are shared, such as deployment systems.

1. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/accounts
2. On the Registry Service Accounts page click btn:[New Service Account].
3. Enter a name for the account using only the accepted characters
4. Optionally enter a description for the account.
5. Click btn:[Create account].
6. Find the created account in the list.
The list of accounts is long so you might have to click btn:[Next] multiple times before finding the account you created.
Alternatively, if you know the name of your token, you can go directly to the page by entering the URL https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/token/<name-of-your-token>
7. Click the name of the account that you created.
8. A token page opens, displaying a generated Username (different to the account name) and a token.
If no Username and token are displayed, click btn:[Regenerate token]. You can also click this to generate a new Username and token.
9. Copy the service account name and use it to set registry_username.
10. Copy the token and use it to set registry_password.
