# Understand the architecture of Ansible Automation Platform and automation controller

Ansible Automation Platform and automation controller comprise a general-purpose, declarative automation platform.
That means that when an Ansible Playbook is launched (by automation controller, or directly on the command line), the playbook, inventory, and credentials provided to Ansible are considered to be the source of truth.
If you want policies around external verification of specific playbook content, job definition, or inventory contents, you must complete these processes before the automation is launched, either by the automation controller web UI, or the automation controller API.
The use of source control, branching, and mandatory code review is best practice for Ansible automation.
There are tools that can help create process flow around using source control in this manner.
At a higher level, tools exist that enable creation of approvals and policy-based actions around arbitrary workflows, including automation.
These tools can then use Ansible through the automation controller's API to perform automation.
You must use a secure default administrator password at the time of automation controller installation.
For more information, see Change the automation controller Administrator Password.
Automation controller exposes services on certain well-known ports, such as port 80 for HTTP traffic and port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
Do not expose automation controller on the open internet, which reduces the threat surface of your installation.

# Granting access

Granting access to certain parts of the system exposes security risks.
Apply the following practices to help secure access:

* Minimize administrative accounts
* Minimize local system access
* Remove access to credentials from users
* Enforce separation of duties
