# Important changes

Automation controller Job templates have a single interface for credential assignment.

From the API endpoint:

GET /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/

You can also associate and disassociate credentials using POST requests, similar to the behavior in the deprecated extra_credentials endpoint:

POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/ {'associate': true, 'id': 'X'}
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/ {'disassociate': true, 'id': 'Y'}

With this model, a job template is considered valid even when there are no credentials assigned to it.
This model also provides users the ability to assign multiple Vault credentials to a job template.
