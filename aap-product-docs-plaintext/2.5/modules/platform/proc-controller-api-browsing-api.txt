1. Go to the automation controller REST API in a web browser at:

https://&lt;server name&gt;/api/
2. Click the "v2" link next to "current versions" or "available versions".
Automation controller supports version 2 of the API.
3. Perform a GET with just the /api/ endpoint to get the current_version, which is the recommended version.
4. Click the  icon on the navigation menu, for documentation on the access methods for that particular API endpoint and what data is returned when using those methods.
5. Use the PUT and POST verbs on the specific API pages by formatting JSON in the various text fields.

You can also view changed settings from factory defaults at /api/v2/settings/changed/ endpoint.
It reflects changes you made in the API browser, not changed settings that come from static settings files.
