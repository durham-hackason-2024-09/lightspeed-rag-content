# Specify nodes for job execution

You can add a node selector to the container group pod specification to ensure they only run against certain nodes.
First add a label to the nodes you want to run jobs against.

The following procedure adds a label to a node.

1. List the nodes in your cluster, along with their labels:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```


The output is similar to this (shown here in a table):

2. Choose one of your nodes, and add a label to it by using the following command:

```
kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> <aap_node_type>=<execution>
```


For example:

```
kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> disktype=ssd
```


where <your-node-name> is the name of your chosen node.
3. Verify that your chosen node has a disktype=ssd label:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

4. The output is similar to this (shown here in a table):


You can see that the worker0 node now has a disktype=ssd label.
5. In the automation controller UI, specify that label in the metadata section of your customized pod specification in the container group.
