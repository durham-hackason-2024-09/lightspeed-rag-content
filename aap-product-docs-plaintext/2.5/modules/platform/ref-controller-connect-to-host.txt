# Unable to connect to your host

If you are unable to run the helloworld.yml example playbook from the Managing projects section of the Getting started with automation controller guide or other playbooks due to host connection errors, try the following:

* Can you ssh to your host?
Ansible depends on SSH access to the servers you are managing.
* Are your hostnames and IPs correctly added in your inventory file?
Check for typos.
