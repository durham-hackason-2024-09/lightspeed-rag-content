# Preparing for migration

Before migrating your current Ansible Automation Platform deployment to Ansible Automation Platform Operator, you need to back up your existing data, create k8s secrets for your secret key and postgresql configuration.


[NOTE]
----
If you are migrating both automation controller and automation hub instances, repeat the steps in Creating a secret key secret and Creating a postgresql configuration secret for both and then proceed to Migrating data to the Ansible Automation Platform Operator.
