# Multi-Vault Credentials

Because you can assign multiple credentials to a job, you can specify multiple Vault credentials to decrypt when your job template runs.
This functionality mirrors the support for Managing vault passwords.

Vault credentials now have an optional field, vault_id, which is similar to the --vault-id argument of ansible-playbook.

Use the following procedure to run a playbook which makes use of multiple vault passwords:

1. Create a Vault credential in automation controller for each vault password.
2. Specify the Vault ID as a field on the credential and input the password (which is encrypted and stored).
3. Assign multiple vault credentials to the job template using the new credentials endpoint:

POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/credentials/

{
    'associate': true,
    'id': X
}

Alternatively, you can perform the same assignment in the automation controller UI in the Create Credential page:



In this example, the credential created specifies the secret to be used by its Vault Identifier ("first") and password pair.
When this credential is used in a Job Template, as in the following example, it only decrypts the secret associated with the "first" Vault ID:



If you have a playbook that is set up the traditional way with all the secrets in one big file without distinction, then leave the Vault Identifier field blank when setting up the Vault credential.
