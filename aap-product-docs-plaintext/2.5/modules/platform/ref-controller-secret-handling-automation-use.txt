# Secret handling for automation use

Automation controller stores a variety of secrets in the database that are either used for automation or are a result of automation.

These secrets include the following:

* All secret fields of all credential types, including passwords, secret keys, authentication tokens, and secret cloud credentials.
* Secret tokens and passwords for external services defined automation controller settings.
* "password" type survey field entries.

To encrypt secret fields, automation controller uses AES in CBC mode with a 256-bit key for encryption, PKCS7 padding, and HMAC using SHA256 for authentication.

The encryption or decryption process derives the AES-256 bit encryption key from the SECRET_KEY, the field name of the model field and the database assigned auto-incremented record ID.
Therefore, if any attribute used in the key generation process changes, the automation controller fails to correctly decrypt the secret.

Automation controller is designed so that:

* The SECRET_KEY is never readable in playbooks that automation controller launches.
* These secrets are never readable by automation controller users.
* No secret field values are ever made available by the automation controller REST API.

If a secret value is used in a playbook, it is recommended that you use no_log on the task so that it is not accidentally logged.
