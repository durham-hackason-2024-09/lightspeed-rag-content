# Role mapping

Role mapping is the mapping of a user either to a global role, such as Platform Auditor, or team or organization role.

When a Team and/or Organization is specified together with the appropriate Role, the behavior is identical with Organization mapping or Team mapping.

Role mapping can be specified separately for each account authentication.

1. After configuring the authentication details for your authentication type, select Team from the Add authentication mapping list.
2. Enter a unique rule Name to identify the rule.
3. Select a Trigger from the list. See Authenticator map triggers for more information about map triggers.
4. Select Revoke to remove the role for the user when none of the trigger conditions are matched.
5. Select a Role to be applied or removed for matching users.
6. Click btn:[Next].

[NOTE]
----
The mapping precedence is determined by the order in which the mappings are listed.
