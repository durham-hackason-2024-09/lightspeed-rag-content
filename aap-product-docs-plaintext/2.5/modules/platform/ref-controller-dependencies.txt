# Dependencies

Specifies dependencies to install into the final image, including ansible-core, ansible-runner, Python packages, system packages, and
collections.
Ansible Builder automatically installs dependencies for any Ansible collections you install.

In general, you can use standard syntax to constrain package versions.
Use the same syntax you would pass to dnf, pip, ansible-galaxy, or any other package management utility.
You can also define your packages or collections in separate files and reference those files in the dependencies section of your definition file.

The following keys are valid:



The following example uses filenames that contain the various dependencies:

dependencies:
  python: requirements.txt
  system: bindep.txt
  galaxy: requirements.yml
  ansible_core:
      package_pip: ansible-core==2.14.2
  ansible_runner:
      package_pip: ansible-runner==2.3.1
  python_interpreter:
      package_system: "python310"
      python_path: "/usr/bin/python3.10"

This example uses inline values:

dependencies:
  python:
    - pywinrm
  system:
    - iputils [platform:rpm]
  galaxy:
    collections:
      - name: community.windows
      - name: ansible.utils
        version: 2.10.1
  ansible_core:
      package_pip: ansible-core==2.14.2
  ansible_runner:
      package_pip: ansible-runner==2.3.1
  python_interpreter:
      package_system: "python310"
      python_path: "/usr/bin/python3.10"


[NOTE]
----
If any of these dependency files (requirements.txt, bindep.txt, and requirements.yml) are in the build_ignore of the collection, the build fails.
Collection maintainers can verify that ansible-builder recognizes the requirements they expect by using the introspect command:
ansible-builder introspect --sanitize ~/.ansible/collections/
----

The --sanitize option reviews all of the collection requirements and removes duplicates.
It also removes any Python requirements that are normally excluded (see python dependencies).

Use the -v3 option to introspect to see logging messages about requirements that are being excluded.
