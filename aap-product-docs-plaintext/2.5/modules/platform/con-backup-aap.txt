# Back up your Ansible Automation Platform instance

Back up an existing Ansible Automation Platform instance by running the .setup.sh script with the backup_dir flag, which saves the content and configuration of your current environment:

1. Navigate to your ansible-tower-setup-latest directory.
2. Run the ./setup.sh script following the example below:

```
$ ./setup.sh -e ‘backup_dir=/ansible/mybackup’ -e ‘use_compression=True’ @credentials.yml -b 12
```

backup_dir specifies a directory to save your backup to.
@credentials.yml passes the password variables and their values encrypted via ansible-vault.

With a successful backup, a backup file is created at /ansible/mybackup/tower-backup-latest.tar.gz .
