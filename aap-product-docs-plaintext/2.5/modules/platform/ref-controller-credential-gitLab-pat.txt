# GitLab Personal Access Token credential type

Select this credential to enable you to access GitLab by using a Personal Access Token (PAT), which you can get through GitLab.

For more information, see Working with Webhooks.

GitLab PAT credentials require a value in the Token field, which is provided in your GitLab profile settings.

Use this credential to establish an API connection to GitLab for use in webhook listener jobs, to post status updates.
