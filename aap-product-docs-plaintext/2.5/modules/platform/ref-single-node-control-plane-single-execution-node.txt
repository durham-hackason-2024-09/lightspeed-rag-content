# Single node control plane with single execution node

This example inventory file deploys a single-node control plane and establishes a peer relationship to an execution node.


```yaml
[automationcontroller]
aap_c_1.example.com

[automationcontroller:vars]
node_type=control
peers=execution_nodes

[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com
```


The following image displays the topology of this mesh network.

![The topology map shows an automation controller group and an execution node. The automation controller group contains a single control node: aap_c_1. The execution node is aap_e_1. The aap_c_1 node is peered to aap_e_1.]

The [automationcontroller] stanza defines the control nodes.
If you add a new node to the automationcontroller group, it will automatically peer with the aap_c_1.example.com node.

The [automationcontroller:vars] stanza sets the node type to control for all nodes in the control plane and defines how the nodes peer to the execution nodes:

* If you add a new node to the execution_nodes group, the control plane nodes automatically peer to it.
* If you add a new node to the automationcontroller group, the node type is set to control.

The [execution_nodes] stanza lists all the execution and hop nodes in the inventory.
The default node type is execution. You can specify the node type for an individual node:


```yaml
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com node_type=execution
```


Alternatively, you can set the node_type of all execution nodes in the [execution_nodes] group.
When you add new nodes to the group, they are automatically set to execution nodes.


```yaml
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com

[execution_nodes:vars]
node_type=execution
```


If you plan to add hop nodes to your inventory in future, it is better to define a separate group for the execution nodes, and set the node_type for the group:


```yaml
[execution_nodes]
aap_e_1.example.com

[local_execution_group]
aap_e_1.example.com

[local_execution_group:vars]
node_type=execution
```
