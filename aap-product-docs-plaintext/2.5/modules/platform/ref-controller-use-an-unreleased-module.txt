# Use an unreleased module from Ansible source with automation controller

If there is a feature that is available in the latest Ansible core branch that you want to use with your automation controller system, making use of it in automation controller is simple.

First, determine which is the updated module you want to use from the available Ansible Core Modules or Ansible Extra Modules GitHub repositories.

Next, create a new directory, at the same directory level of your Ansible source playbooks, named /library.

When this is created, copy the module you want to use and drop it into the /library directory.
It is consumed first by your system modules and can be removed once you have updated the stable version with your normal package manager.
