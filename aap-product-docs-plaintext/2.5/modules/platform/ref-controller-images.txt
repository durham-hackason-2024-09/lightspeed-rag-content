# images

Specifies the base image to be used.
At a minimum you must specify a source, image, and tag for the base image.
The base image provides the operating system and can also provide some packages.
Use the standard host/namespace/container:tag syntax to specify images.
You can use Podman or Docker shortcut syntax instead, but the full definition is more reliable and portable.
