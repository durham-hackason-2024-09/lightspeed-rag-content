# Additional configurations

A collection download count can help you understand collection usage. To add a collection download count to automation hub, set the following configuration:


```

  pulp_settings:
    ansible_collect_download_count: true
```


When ansible_collect_download_count is enabled, automation hub will display a download count by the collection.
