# Configuring an external database for automation controller on Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform operator

For users who prefer to deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database, they can do so by configuring a secret with instance credentials and connection information, then applying it to their cluster using the oc create command.

By default, the Ansible Automation Platform Operator automatically creates and configures a managed PostgreSQL pod in the same namespace as your Ansible Automation Platform deployment. You can deploy Ansible Automation Platform with an external database instead of the managed PostgreSQL pod that the Ansible Automation Platform Operator automatically creates.

Using an external database lets you share and reuse resources and manually manage backups, upgrades, and performance optimizations.


[NOTE]
----
The same external database (PostgreSQL instance) can be used for both automation hub and automation controller as long as the database names are different. In other words, you can have multiple databases with different names inside a single PostgreSQL instance.
----

The following section outlines the steps to configure an external database for your automation controller on a Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

The external database must be a PostgreSQL database that is the version supported by the current release of Ansible Automation Platform.


[NOTE]
----
Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 supports PostgreSQL 15.
----

The external postgres instance credentials and connection information must be stored in a secret, which is then set on the automation controller spec.

1. Create a postgres_configuration_secret YAML file, following the template below:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: external-postgres-configuration
  namespace: <target_namespace> 1
stringData:
  host: "<external_ip_or_url_resolvable_by_the_cluster>" 2
  port: "<external_port>" 3
  database: "<desired_database_name>"
  username: "<username_to_connect_as>"
  password: "<password_to_connect_with>" 4
  sslmode: "prefer" 5
  type: "unmanaged"
type: Opaque
```

Namespace to create the secret in. This should be the same namespace you want to deploy to.
The resolvable hostname for your database node.
External port defaults to 5432.
Value for variable password should not contain single or double quotes (', ") or backslashes (\) to avoid any issues during deployment, backup or restoration.
The variable sslmode is valid for external databases only. The allowed values are: prefer, disable, allow, require, verify-ca, and verify-full.
2. Apply external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml to your cluster using the oc create command.

```
$ oc create -f external-postgres-configuration-secret.yml
```

3. When creating your AutomationController custom resource object, specify the secret on your spec, following the example below:

```
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationController
metadata:
  name: controller-dev
spec:
  postgres_configuration_secret: external-postgres-configuration
```
