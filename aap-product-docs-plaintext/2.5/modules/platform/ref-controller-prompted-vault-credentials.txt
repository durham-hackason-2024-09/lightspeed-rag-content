For passwords for Vault credentials that are marked with Prompt on launch, the launch endpoint of any related Job Templates communicate necessary Vault passwords by using the passwords_needed_to_start parameter:
GET /api/v2/job_templates/N/launch/
{
    'passwords_needed_to_start': [
        'vault_password.X',
        'vault_password.Y',
    ]
}
Where X and Y are primary keys of the associated Vault credentials:
POST /api/v2/job_templates/N/launch/
{
    'credential_passwords': {
        'vault_password.X': 'first-vault-password'
        'vault_password.Y': 'second-vault-password'
    }
}
