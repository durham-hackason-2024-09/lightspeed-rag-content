# SCM inventory jobs

When an inventory sourced from an SCM, for example git, is executed, the results are displayed in the Output tab.
If used, the Ansible CLI displays the same information. This can be useful for debugging.
Use the icons in the navigation menu to relaunch (), download () the job output, or delete () the job.
