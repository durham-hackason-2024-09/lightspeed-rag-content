# Configuring your controller LDAP security

You can configure your LDAP security for automation controller through any of the following options:

* The automation controller user interface.
* The platform gateway user interface. See Authentication doc for additional steps.
* The following procedure steps.

1. If you do not have a ldap_cacert_secret, you can create one with the following command:

```
$ oc create secret generic <resourcename>-custom-certs \
    --from-file=ldap-ca.crt=<PATH/TO/YOUR/CA/PEM/FILE>  \ 1
```

Modify this to point to where your CA cert is stored.

This will create a secret that looks like this:

```
$ oc get secret/mycerts -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ldap-ca.crt: <mysecret> 1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mycerts
  namespace: awx
type: Opaque
```

Automation controller looks for the data field ldap-ca.crt in the specified secret when using the ldap_cacert_secret.
2. Under LDAP Certificate Authority Trust Bundle click the drop-down menu and select your ldap_cacert_secret.
3. Under LDAP Password Secret, click the drop-down menu and select a secret.
4. Under EE Images Pull Credentials Secret, click the drop-down menu and select a secret.
5. Under Bundle Cacert Secret, click the drop-down menu and select a secret.
6. Under Service Type, click the drop-down menu and select
* ClusterIP
* LoadBalancer
* NodePort
