# Content needed for an execution environment

Ansible-builder is used to create an execution environment.

An execution environment must contain:

* Ansible
* Ansible Runner
* Ansible Collections
* Python and system dependencies of:
* modules or plugins in collections
* content in ansible-base
* custom user needs

Building a new execution environment involves a definition that specifies which content you want to include in your execution environment, such as collections, Python requirements, and system-level packages.
The definition must be a .yml file

The content from the output generated from migrating to execution environments has some of the required data that can be piped to a file or pasted into this definition file.

For more information, see Migrate legacy venvs to execution environments.
If you did not migrate from a virtual environment, you can create a definition file with the required data described in the Execution Environment Setup Reference.

Collection developers can declare requirements for their content by providing the appropriate metadata.

For more information, see Dependencies.
