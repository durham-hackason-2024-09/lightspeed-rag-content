# Installing the Ansible Builder RPM

On the RHEL system where custom execution environments will be built, you will install the Ansible Builder RPM by using a Satellite Server that already exists in the environment. This method is preferred because the execution environment images can use any RHEL content from the pre-existing Satellite if required.

1. Install the Ansible Builder RPM from the Ansible Automation Platform repository.
1. Subscribe the RHEL system to a Satellite on the disconnected network.
2. Attach the Ansible Automation Platform subscription and enable the Ansible Automation Platform repository. The repository name is either ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms or ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms depending on the version of RHEL used on the underlying system.
3. Install the Ansible Builder RPM. The version of the Ansible Builder RPM must be 3.0.0 or later in order for the examples below to work properly.
2. Install the Ansible Builder RPM from the Ansible Automation Platform setup bundle. Use this method if a Satellite Server is not available on your disconnected network.
1. Unarchive the Ansible Automation Platform setup bundle.
2. Install the Ansible Builder RPM and its dependencies from the included content.


```
$ tar -xzvf ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.4-3-x86_64.tar.gz
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.4-3-x86_64/bundle/packages/el8/repos/
$ sudo dnf install ansible-builder-3.0.0-2.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-requirements-parser-0.2.0-4.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-bindep-2.10.2-3.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-jsonschema-4.16.0-1.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-pbr-5.8.1-2.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-distro-1.6.0-3.el8pc.noarch.rpm \
    python39-packaging-21.3-2.el8ap.noarch.rpm \
    python39-parsley-1.3-2.el8pc.noarch.rpm \
    python39-attrs-21.4.0-2.el8pc.noarch.rpm \
    python39-pyrsistent-0.18.1-2.el8ap.x86_64.rpm \
    python39-pyparsing-3.0.9-1.el8ap.noarch.rpm
```
