# Creating custom notifications

You can customize the text content of each Notification type on the notification form.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Administration > Notifiers].
2. Click btn:[Add notifier].
3. Choose a notification type from the Type list.
4. Enable Customize messages using the toggle.
![Customize notification]
5. You can provide a custom message for various job events, such as the following:
* Start message body
* success message body
* Error message body
* Workflow approved body
* Workflow denied message body
* Workflow pending message body
* Workflow timed out message body

The message forms vary depending on the type of notification that you are configuring.
For example, messages for Email and PagerDuty notifications appear to be a typical email, with a body and a subject, in which case, automation controller displays the fields as Message and Message Body.
Other notification types only expect a Message for each type of event.

The Message fields are pre-populated with a template containing a top-level variable, job coupled with an attribute, such as id or name.
Templates are enclosed in curly brackets and can draw from a fixed set of fields provided by automation controller, shown in the pre-populated message fields:

This pre-populated field suggests commonly displayed messages to a recipient who is notified of an event.
You can customize these messages with different criteria by adding your own attributes for the job as needed.
Custom notification messages are rendered using Jinja; the same templating engine used by Ansible playbooks.

Messages and message bodies have different types of content, as the following points outline:

* Messages are always just strings, one-liners only.
New lines are not supported.
* Message bodies are either a dictionary or a block of text:
* The message body for Webhooks and PagerDuty uses dictionary definitions.
The default message body for these is {{ job_metadata }}, you can either leave that as it is or provide your own dictionary.
* The message body for email uses a block of text or a multi-line string. The default message body is:

{{ job_friendly_name }} #{{ job.id }} had status {{ job.status }}, view details at {{ url }} {{ job_metadata }}

You can edit this text leaving {{ job_metadata }} in, or drop {{ job_metadata }}.
Since the body is a block of text, it can be any string you want.
{{ job_metadata }} is rendered as a dictionary containing fields that describe the job being executed.
In all cases, {{ job_metadata }} includes the following fields:
* id
* name
* url
* created_by
* started
* finished
* status
* traceback

[NOTE]
----
You cannot query individual fields within {{ job_metadata }}.
When you use {{ job_metadata }} in a notification template, all data is returned.
----

The resulting dictionary looks like the following:

{"id": 18,
 "name": "Project - Space Procedures",
 "url": "https://host/#/jobs/project/18",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:20:45.139356+00:00",
 "finished": "2019-10-26T00:20:55.769713+00:00",
 "status": "successful",
 "traceback": ""
}

If {{ job_metadata }} is rendered in a job, it includes the following additional fields:
* inventory
* project
* playbook
* credential
* limit
* extra_vars
* hosts

The resulting dictionary is similar to the following:

{"id": 12,
 "name": "JobTemplate - Launch Rockets",
 "url": "https://host/#/jobs/playbook/12",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:02:07.943774+00:00",
 "finished": null,
 "status": "running",
 "traceback": "",
 "inventory": "Inventory - Fleet",
 "project": "Project - Space Procedures",
 "playbook": "launch.yml",
 "credential": "Credential - Mission Control",
 "limit": "",
 "extra_vars": "{}",
 "hosts": {}
}

If {{ job_metadata }} is rendered in a workflow job, it includes the following additional field:
* body (This enumerates the nodes in the workflow job and includes a description of the job associated with each node)

The resulting dictionary is similar to the following:

{"id": 14,
 "name": "Workflow Job Template - Launch Mars Mission",
 "url": "https://host/#/workflows/14",
 "created_by": "admin",
 "started": "2019-10-26T00:11:04.554468+00:00",
 "finished": "2019-10-26T00:11:24.249899+00:00",
 "status": "successful",
 "traceback": "",
 "body": "Workflow job summary:

         node #1 spawns job #15, \"Assemble Fleet JT\", which finished with status successful.
         node #2 spawns job #16, \"Mission Start approval node\", which finished with status successful.\n
         node #3 spawns job #17, \"Deploy Fleet\", which finished with status successful."
}

If you create a notification template that uses invalid syntax or references unusable fields, an error message displays indicating the nature of the error.
If you delete a notification&#8217;s custom message, the default message is shown in its place.


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you save the notifications template without editing the custom message (or edit and revert back to the default values), the Details screen assumes the defaults and does not display the custom message tables. If you edit and save any of the values, the entire table displays in the Details screen.

* For more information, see Using variables with Jinja2 in the Ansible documentation.
* Automation controller requires valid syntax to retrieve the correct data to display the messages.

For a list of supported attributes and the proper syntax construction, see the Supported Attributes for Custom Notifications section.
