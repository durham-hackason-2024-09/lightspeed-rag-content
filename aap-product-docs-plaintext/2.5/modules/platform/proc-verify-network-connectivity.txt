# Verifying network connectivity

To ensure successful migration of your data, verify that you have network connectivity from your new operator deployment to your old deployment database.

Take note of the host and port information from your existing deployment. This information is located in the postgres.py file located in the conf.d directory.

1. Create a yaml file to verify the connection between your new deployment and your old deployment database:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: dbchecker
spec:
  containers:
    - name: dbchecker
      image: registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-13:latest
      command: ["sleep"]
      args: ["600"]
```

2. Apply the connection checker yaml file to your new project deployment:

```
oc project ansible-automation-platform
oc apply -f connection_checker.yaml
```

3. Verify that the connection checker pod is running:

```
oc get pods
```

4. Connect to a pod shell:

```
oc rsh dbchecker
```

5. After the shell session opens in the pod, verify that the new project can connect to your old project cluster:

```
pg_isready -h <old-host-address> -p <old-port-number> -U awx
```

Example

```
<old-host-address>:<old-port-number> - accepting connections
```
