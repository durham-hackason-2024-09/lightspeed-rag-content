# Example Ansible Automation Platform architecture

The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 reference architecture provides an example setup of a standard deployment of Ansible Automation Platform using automation mesh on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The deployment shown takes advantage of the following components to provide a simple, secure and flexible method of handling your automation workloads, a central location for content collections, and automated resolution of IT requests.

Automation controller:: Provides the control plane for automation through its UI, Restful API, RBAC workflows and CI/CD integrations.
Automation mesh:: Is an overlay network that provides the ability to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers through nodes that establish peer-to-peer connections with each other using existing networks.
Private automation hub:: Provides automation developers the ability to collaborate and publish their own automation content and streamline delivery of Ansible code within their organization.
Event-Driven Ansible:: Provides the event-handling capability needed to automate time-consuming tasks and respond to changing conditions in any IT domain.

The architecture for this example consists of the following:

* A two node automation controller cluster
* An optional hop node to connect automation controller to execution nodes
* A two node automation hub cluster
* A single node Event-Driven Ansible controller cluster
* A single PostgreSQL database connected to the automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible controller clusters
* Two execution nodes per  automation controller cluster
