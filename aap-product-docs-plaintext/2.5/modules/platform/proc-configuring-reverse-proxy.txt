# Configuring a reverse proxy

You can support a reverse proxy server configuration by adding HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to the Remote Host Headers field in the Systems Settings. The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field identifies the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[System].
2. In the Remote Host Headers field, enter the following values:

```
[
  "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
  "REMOTE_ADDR",
  "REMOTE_HOST"
]
```

3. Add the lines below to /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py to ensure the application uses the correct headers:

```
USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT = True
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
```

4. Click btn:[Save] to save the settings.
