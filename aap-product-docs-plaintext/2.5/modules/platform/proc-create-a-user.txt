# Creating a Keycloak user

This procedure creates a Keycloak user, with the hubadmin role, that can log in to automation hub with Super Administration privileges.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operator[Installed Operators].
3. Select the Red Hat Single Sign-On Operator project.
4. Select the Keycloak Realm tab and click btn:[Create Keycloak User].
5. On the Keycloak User form, select btn:[YAML view].
6. Replace the default YAML file with the following:

```
apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1
kind: KeycloakUser
metadata:
  name: hubadmin-user
  labels:
    app: sso
    realm: ansible-automation-platform
  namespace: rh-sso
spec:
  realmSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sso
      realm: ansible-automation-platform
  user:
    username: hub_admin
    firstName: Hub
    lastName: Admin
    email: hub_admin@example.com
    enabled: true
    emailVerified: false
    credentials:
      - type: password
        value: <ch8ngeme>
    clientRoles:
      automation-hub:
        - hubadmin
```

7. Click btn:[Create] and wait for the process to complete.

When a user is created, the Operator creates a Secret containing both the username and password using the following naming pattern: credential-<realm name>-<username>-<namespace>.
In this example the credential is called credential-ansible-automation-platform-hub-admin-rh-sso.
When a user is created the Operator does not update the user&#8217;s password.
Password changes are not reflected in the Secret.
