# Managing instances

Use the following procedure to manage instances.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instances] to access the Instances list.



The Instances list displays all the current nodes in your topology, along with relevant details:
* Host Name
* Status: Indicates the state of the node:
* Installed: A node that has successfully installed and configured, but has not yet passed the periodic health check.
* Ready: A node that is available to run jobs or route traffic between nodes on the mesh.
This replaces the previously "Healthy" node state used in the mesh topology.
* Provisioning: A node that is in the process of being added to a current mesh, but is awaiting the job to install all of the packages.

[NOTE]
----
This is currently not supported and is subject to change in a future release.
----
* Deprovisioning: A node that is in the process of being removed from a current mesh and is completing jobs currently running on it.
* Unavailable: A node that did not pass the most recent health check, indicating connectivity or receptor problems
* Provisioning Failure: A node that failed during provisioning.

[NOTE]
----
This is currently not supported and is subject to change in a future release.
----
* De-provisioning Failure: A node that failed during deprovisioning.

[NOTE]
----
This is currently not supported and is subject to change in a future release.
----
* Node Type: Specifies whether the node is a control, hybrid, hop, or execution node.
* Capacity Adjustment: Allows you to adjust the number of forks in your nodes.
* Used Capacity: Indicates how much capacity has been used.
* Actions: Enables you to enable or disable the instance to control whether jobs can be assigned to it.

From this page, you can add, remove or run health checks on your nodes.

Use the check boxes next to an instance to select it to remove or run a health check against it.
When a button is disabled, you do not have permission for that particular action.
Contact your Administrator to grant you the required level of access.
If you are able to remove an instance, you will receive a prompt for confirmation, similar to the following:


Note

[NOTE]
----
You can still remove an instance even if it is active and jobs are running on it.
Automation controller waits for any jobs running on this node to complete removing the instance.
----
2. Click btn:[Remove] to confirm.

If running a health check on an instance, a message displays that the health check is in progress.


3. Click btn:[Reload] to refresh the instance status.


[NOTE]
----
Health checks are run asynchronously, and it can take up to a minute for the instance status to update, even with a refresh.
The status might or might not change after the health check.
On the Details page, a clock icon displays next to the last known health check date and time stamp, if the health check task is running.

The following example health check shows the status updates with an error on node one:
