# Why upgrade to automation execution environments?

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 introduces automation execution environments. Automation execution environments are container images that allow for easier administration of Ansible by including everything needed to run Ansible automation within a single container. Automation execution environments include:

* RHEL UBI 8
* Ansible-core 2.14 or later
* Python 3.9 or later.
* Any Ansible Content Collections
* Collection python or binary dependencies

By including these elements, Ansible provides platform administrators a standardized way to define, build, and distribute the environments the automation runs in.

Due to the new automation execution environment, it is no longer necessary for administrators to create custom plugins and automation content. Administrators can now spin up smaller automation execution environments in less time to create their content.

All custom dependencies are now defined in the development phase instead of the administration and deployment phase. Decoupling from the control plane enables faster development cycles, scalability, reliability, and portability across environments. Automation execution environments enables the Ansible Automation Platform to move to a distributed architecture allowing administrators to scale automation across their organization.
