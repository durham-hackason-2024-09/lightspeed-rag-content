* Click btn:[Edit] in the job template Details page.
* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Templates]. Click btn:[Edit] next to the template name and edit the appropriate details.
2. Save your changes.

3. To exit after saving and return to the Templates list view, use the breadcrumb navigation links or click btn:[Cancel].
Clicking btn:[Save] does not exit the Details dialog.
