# Kubernetes API failure conditions

When running a container group and the Kubernetes API responds that the resource quota has been exceeded, automation controller keeps the job in pending state.
Other failures result in the traceback of the Error Details field showing the failure reason, similar to the following example:

Error creating pod: pods is forbidden: User "system: serviceaccount: aap:example" cannot create resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "aap"
