# High availability automation hub requirements

Before deploying a high availability (HA) automation hub, ensure that you have a shared filesystem installed in your environment and that you have configured your network storage system, if applicable.

# Required shared filesystem

A high availability automation hub requires you to have a shared file system, such as NFS, already installed in your environment. Before you run the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer, verify that you installed the /var/lib/pulp directory across your cluster as part of the shared file system installation.
The Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer returns an error if /var/lib/pulp is not detected in one of your nodes, causing your high availability automation hub setup to fail.

If you receive an error stating /var/lib/pulp is not detected in one of your nodes, ensure /var/lib/pulp is properly mounted in all servers and re-run the installer.

# Installing firewalld for network storage

If you intend to install a HA automation hub using a network storage on the automation hub nodes itself, you must first install and use firewalld to open the necessary ports as required by your shared storage system before running the Ansible Automation Platform installer.

Install and configure firewalld by executing the following commands:

1. Install the firewalld daemon:

```
$ dnf install firewalld
```

2. Add your network storage under <service> using the following command:

```
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=<service>
```


[NOTE]
----
For a list of supported services, use the $ firewall-cmd --get-services command
----
3. Reload to apply the configuration:

```
$ firewall-cmd --reload
```
