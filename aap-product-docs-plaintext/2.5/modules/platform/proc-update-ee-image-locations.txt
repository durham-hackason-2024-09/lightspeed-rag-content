# Updating execution environment image locations

If you installed private automation hub separately from Ansible Automation Platform, you can update your execution environment image locations to point to your private automation hub.

1. Go to the directory that contains setup.sh
2. Create ./group_vars/automationcontroller by running the following command:

```
touch ./group_vars/automationcontroller
```

3. Paste the following content into ./group_vars/automationcontroller. Adjust the settings to fit your environment:

```
# Automation Hub Registry
registry_username: 'your-automation-hub-user'
registry_password: 'your-automation-hub-password'
registry_url: 'automationhub.example.org'
registry_verify_ssl: False

## Execution Environments
control_plane_execution_environment: 'automationhub.example.org/ee-supported-rhel8:latest'

global_job_execution_environments:
  - name: "Default execution environment"
    image: "automationhub.example.org/ee-supported-rhel8:latest"
  - name: "Minimal execution environment"
    image: "automationhub.example.org/ee-minimal-rhel8:latest"
```

4. Run the ./setup.sh script

```
$ ./setup.sh
```


1. Log in to Ansible Automation Platform as a user with system administrator access.
2. Go to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Execution Environments].
3. In the Image column, confirm that the execution environment image location has changed from the default value of <registry url>/ansible-automation-platform-<version>/<image name>:<tag> to <automation hub url>/<image name>:<tag>.
