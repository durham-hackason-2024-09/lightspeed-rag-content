# Changing the SSL certificate and key manually on automation controller

The following procedure describes how to change the SSL certificate and key manually on Automation Controller.

1. Backup the current SSL certificate:

```
cp /etc/tower/tower.cert /etc/tower/tower.cert-$(date +%F)
```

2. Backup the current key files:

```
cp /etc/tower/tower.key /etc/tower/tower.key-$(date +%F)+
```

3. Copy the new SSL certificate to /etc/tower/tower.cert.
4. Copy the new key to /etc/tower/tower.key.
5. Restore the SELinux context:

```
restorecon -v /etc/tower/tower.cert /etc/tower/tower.key
```

6. Set appropriate permissions for the certificate and key files:

```
chown root:awx /etc/tower/tower.cert /etc/tower/tower.key
chmod 0600 /etc/tower/tower.cert /etc/tower/tower.key
```

7. Test the NGINX configuration:

```
nginx -t
```

8. Reload NGINX:

systemctl reload nginx.service
```
