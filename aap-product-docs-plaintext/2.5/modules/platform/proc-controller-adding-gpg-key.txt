# Adding a GPG key to automation controller

To use the GPG key for content signing and validation in automation controller, add it by running the following command in the CLI:

$ gpg --list-keys
$ gpg --export --armour <key fingerprint> > my_public_key.asc

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Credentials].
2. Click btn:[Create credential].
3. Give a meaningful name for the new credential, for example, "Infrastructure team public GPG key".
4. In the Credential type field, select GPG Public Key.
5. Click Browse to locate and select the public key file, for example, my_public_key.asc.
6. Click btn:[Create credential].

You can select this credential in projects <ug_projects_add>, and content verification automatically takes place on future project
synchronizations.


[NOTE]
----
Use the project cache SCM timeout to control how often you want automation controller to re-validate the signed content.
When a project is configured to update on launch (of any job template configured to use that project), you can enable the cache timeout setting, which sets it to update after N seconds have passed since the last update.
If validation is running too often, you can slow down how often project updates occur by specifying the time in the Cache Timeout field of the Options Details view of the project.
