# Upgrading between minor Ansible Automation Platform releases

To upgrade between minor releases of Ansible Automation Platform 2 on your VM-based installation, use this general workflow.

1. Download and unarchive the latest Ansible Automation Platform 2 setup bundle.
2. Create a backup of the existing installation.
3. Copy the existing installation inventory file into the new setup bundle directory.
4. Run ./setup.sh to upgrade the installation.

For example, to upgrade from version 2.2.0-7 to 2.3-1.2, make sure that both setup bundles are on the initial controller node where the installation occurred:


```
    $ ls -1F
ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.2.0-7/
ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.2.0-7.tar.gz
ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.3-1.2/
ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.3-1.2.tar.gz
```


Back up the 2.2.0-7 installation:


```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.2.0-7
$ sudo ./setup.sh -b
$ cd ..
```


Copy the 2.2.0-7 inventory file into the 2.3-1.2 bundle directory:


```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.2.0-7
$ cp inventory ../ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.3-1.2/
$ cd ..
```


Upgrade from 2.2.0-7 to 2.3-1.2 with the setup.sh script:


```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.3-1.2
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```
