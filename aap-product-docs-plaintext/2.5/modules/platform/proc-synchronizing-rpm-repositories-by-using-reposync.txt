# Synchronizing RPM repositories using reposync

To perform a reposync you need a RHEL host that has access to the internet. After the repositories are synced, you can move the repositories to the disconnected network hosted from a web server.

1. Attach the BaseOS and AppStream required repositories:

```
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms \
    --enable rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
```

2. Perform the reposync:

```
# dnf install yum-utils
# reposync -m --download-metadata --gpgcheck \
    -p /path/to/download
```

1. Use reposync with --download-metadata and without --newest-only. See RHEL 8 Reposync.
* If you are not using --newest-only, the repos downloaded will be ~90GB.
* If you are using --newest-only, the repos downloaded will be ~14GB.
3. If you plan to use Red Hat Single Sign-On, sync these repositories:
1. jb-eap-7.3-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
2. rh-sso-7.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms

After the reposync is completed, your repositories are ready to use with a web server.
4. Move the repositories to your disconnected network.
