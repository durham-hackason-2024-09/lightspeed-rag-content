# Customizing the pod specification

You can use the following procedure to customize the pod.

1. In the automation controller UI, go to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instance Groups].
2. Check btn:[Customize pod specification].
3. In the Pod Spec Override field, specify the namespace by using the toggle to enable and expand the Pod Spec Override field.
4. Click btn:[Save].
5. Optional: Click btn:[Expand] to view the entire customization window if you want to provide additional customizations.

The image used at job launch time is determined by the execution environment associated with the job.
If a Container Registry credential is associated with the execution environment, then automation controller uses ImagePullSecret to pull the image.
If you prefer not to give the service account permission to manage secrets, you must pre-create the ImagePullSecret, specify it on the pod specification, and omit any credential from the execution environment used.
