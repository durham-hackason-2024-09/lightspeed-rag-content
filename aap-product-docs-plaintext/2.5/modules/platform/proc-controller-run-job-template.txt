# Running a job template

A benefit of automation controller is the push-button deployment of Ansible Playbooks.
You can configure a template to store all the parameters that you would normally pass to the Ansible Playbook on the command line.
In addition to the playbooks, the template passes the inventory, credentials, extra variables, and all options and settings that you can specify on the command line.

* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Templates] and click btn:[Launch] next to the job template.

The initial job start generates a status page, which updates automatically by using automation controller&#8217;s Live Event feature, until the job is complete.

For more information about the job results, see Jobs in automation controller in Using automation execution.
