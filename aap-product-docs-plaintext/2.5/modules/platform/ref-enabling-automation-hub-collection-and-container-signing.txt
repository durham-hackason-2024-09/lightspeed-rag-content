# Enabling Automation hub collection and container signing

Automation hub allows you to sign Ansible collections and container images. This feature is not enabled by default, and you must provide the GPG key.


```
hub_collection_signing=true
hub_collection_signing_key=<full_path_to_collections_gpg_key>
hub_container_signing=true
hub_container_signing_key=<full_path_to_containers_gpg_key>
```


When the GPG key is protected by a passphrase, you must provide the passphrase.


```
hub_collection_signing_pass=<collections_gpg_key_passphrase>
hub_container_signing_pass=<containers_gpg_key_passphrase>
```
