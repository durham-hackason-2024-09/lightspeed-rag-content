# Syncing a project

If you want to fetch the latest changes in a project, you can manually start an SCM sync for this project.

1. Open the project to update the SCM-based demo project by using one of these methods:
* Go to the project Details page and click btn:[Sync].
* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Projects] and click btn:[Sync Project].

[NOTE]
----
When you add a project set up to use source control, a "sync" starts. This fetches the project details from the configured source control.
