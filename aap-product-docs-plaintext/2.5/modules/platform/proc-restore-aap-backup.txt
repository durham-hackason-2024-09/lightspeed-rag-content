# Restore backup to new instance

Running the ./setup.sh script with the restore_backup_file flag migrates content from the backup file of your original 1.x instance to the new instance. This effectively migrates all job histories, templates, and other Ansible Automation Platform related content.

1. Run the following command:

```
$ ./setup.sh -r -e ‘restore_backup_file=/ansible/mybackup/tower-backup-latest.tar.gz’ -e ‘use_compression=True’ -e @credentials.yml -r -- --ask-vault-pass 123
```

restore_backup_file specifies the location of the Ansible Automation Platform backup database
use_compression is set to True due to compression being used during the backup process
-r sets the restore database option to True
2. Log in to your new RHEL 8 Tower 3.8 instance to verify whether the content from your original instance has been restored:
1. Navigate to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instance Groups]. The recreated instance groups should now contain the Total Jobs from your original instance.
2. Using the side navigation panel, check that your content has been imported from your original instance, including Jobs, Templates, Inventories, Credentials, and Users.

You now have a new instance of Ansible Tower with all the Ansible content from your original instance.
