# Installing ansible-core on the RHEL host

1. From your RHEL host, install ansible-core:

```
sudo dnf install -y ansible-core
```

2. Optionally, you can install additional utilities that can be useful for troubleshooting purposes, for example wget, git, rsync, and vim:

```
sudo dnf install -y wget git rsync vim
```

3. Set a hostname that is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN):

```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your_hostname>
```
