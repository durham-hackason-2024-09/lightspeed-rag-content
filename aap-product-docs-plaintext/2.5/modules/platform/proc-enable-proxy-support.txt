# Enable proxy support

To enable proxy server support, edit the REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS field in the settings page for your automation controller:

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[System].
2. In the Remote Host Headers field, enter the following values:

```
[
  "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR",
  "REMOTE_ADDR",
  "REMOTE_HOST"
]
```


Automation controller determines the remote hostâ€™s IP address by searching through the list of headers in Remote Host Headers until the first IP address is located.
