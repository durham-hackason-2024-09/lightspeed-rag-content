# Post migration cleanup

After your data migration is complete, you must delete any Instance Groups that are no longer required.

1. Log in to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform as the administrator with the password you created during migration.

[NOTE]
----
Note: If you did not create an administrator password during migration, one was automatically created for you. To locate this password, go to your project, select menu:Workloads[Secrets] and open controller-admin-password. From there you can copy the password and paste it into the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform password field.

2. Select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instance Groups].
3. Select all Instance Groups except controlplane and default.
4. Click btn:[Delete].
