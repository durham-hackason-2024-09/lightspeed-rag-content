# Changing the SSL certificate and key using the installer

The following procedure describes how to change the SSL certificate and key in the inventory file.

1. Copy the new SSL certificates and keys to a path relative to the Ansible Automation Platform installer.
2. Add the absolute paths of the SSL certificates and keys to the inventory file.
Refer to the Automation controller variables,
Automation hub variables, and Event-Driven Ansible controller variables sections of the
Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide
for guidance on setting these variables.
* Automation controller: web_server_ssl_cert, web_server_ssl_key, custom_ca_cert
* Automation hub: automationhub_ssl_cert, automationhub_ssl_key, custom_ca_cert
* Event-Driven Ansible controller: automationedacontroller_ssl_cert, automationedacontroller_ssl_key, custom_ca_cert

[NOTE]
----
The custom_ca_cert must be the root certificate authority that signed the intermediate certificate authority.
This file is installed in /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors.

3. Run the installer.
