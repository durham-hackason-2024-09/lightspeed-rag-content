# Adding an execution environment to a job template

* An execution environment must have been created using ansible-builder as described in [ADD 2.5 LINK]:Build an execution environment.
When an execution environment has been created, you can use it to run jobs.
Use the automation controller UI to specify the execution environment to use in your job templates.
* Depending on whether an execution environment is made available for global use or tied to an organization, you must have the appropriate level of administrator privileges to use an execution environment in a job.
Execution environments tied to an organization require Organization administrators to be able to run jobs with those execution environment.
* Before running a job or job template that uses an execution environment that has a credential assigned to it, ensure that the credential has a username, host, and password.
