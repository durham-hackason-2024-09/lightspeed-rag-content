# Customizing the pod specification

Ansible Automation Platform provides a simple default pod specification, however, you can provide a custom YAML or JSON document that overrides the default pod specification.
This field uses any custom fields such as ImagePullSecrets, that can be "serialized" as valid pod JSON or YAML.
A full list of options can be found in the Pods and Services section of the OpenShift documentation.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instance Groups].
2. Click btn:[Create group] and select Create container group.
3. Check the option for Customize pod spec
4. Enter a custom Kubernetes or OpenShift Pod specification in the Pod Spec Override field.
![Customize pod specification]
5. Click btn:[Create Container Group].


[NOTE]
----
The image when a job launches is determined by which execution environment is associated with the job.
If you associate a container registry credential with the execution environment, then automation controller attempts to make an ImagePullSecret to pull the image.
If you prefer not to give the service account permission to manage secrets, you must pre-create the ImagePullSecret and specify it on the pod specification, and omit any credential from the execution environment used.
For more information, see the Allowing Pods to Reference Images from Other Secured Registries section of the Red Hat Container Registry Authentication article.

Once you have created the container group successfully, the Details tab of the newly created container group remains, which enables you to review and edit your container group information.
This is the same menu that is opened if you click the  icon from the Instance Groups list view.

You can also edit Instances and review Jobs associated with this instance group.

Container groups and instance groups are labeled accordingly.
