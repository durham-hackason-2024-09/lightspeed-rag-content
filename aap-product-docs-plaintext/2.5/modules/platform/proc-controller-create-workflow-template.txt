# Creating a workflow job template

To create a new workflow job template, complete the following steps:


[IMPORTANT]
----
If you set a limit to a workflow template, it is not passed down to the job template unless you check Prompt on launch for the limit.
This can lead to playbook failures if the limit is mandatory for the playbook that you are running.
----

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Templates].
2. On the Templates list view, select Create workflow job template from the Create template list.
3. Enter the appropriate details in the following fields:

[NOTE]
----
If a field has the Prompt on launch checkbox selected, either launching the workflow template, or using the workflow template within another workflow template, you are prompted for the value for that field.
Most prompted values override any values set in the job template.
Exceptions are noted in the following table.

4. Specify the following Options for launching this template, if necessary:
* Check Enable webhook to turn on the ability to interface with a predefined SCM system web service that is used to launch a workflow job template.
GitHub and GitLab are the supported SCM systems.
* If you enable webhooks, other fields display, prompting for additional information:
* Webhook service: Select which service to listen for webhooks from.
* Webhook URL: Automatically populated with the URL for the webhook service to POST requests to.
* Webhook key: Generated shared secret to be used by the webhook service to sign payloads sent to automation controller.
You must configure this in the settings on the webhook service so that webhooks from this service are accepted in automation controller.
For additional information about setting up webhooks, see Working with Webhooks.
* Check Enable concurrent jobs to allow simultaneous runs of this workflow.
For more information, see Automation controller capacity determination and job impact.
5. When you have completed configuring the workflow template, click btn:[Create workflow job template].

Saving the template exits the workflow template page and the workflow visualizer opens where you can build a workflow.
For more information, see the Workflow visualizer section.
Otherwise, select one of these methods:

* Close the workflow visualizer to return to the Details tab of the newly saved template.
There you can complete the following tasks:
* Review, edit, add permissions, notifications, schedules, and surveys
* View completed jobs
* Build a workflow template
* Click btn:[Launch template] to start the workflow.

[NOTE]
----
Save the template before launching, or btn:[Launch template] remains disabled.
The Notifications tab is only present after you save the template.
