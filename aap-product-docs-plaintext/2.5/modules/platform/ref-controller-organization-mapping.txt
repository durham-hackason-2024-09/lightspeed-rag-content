# Organization mapping

You can control which users are placed into which Ansible Automation Platform organizations based on attributes like their username and email address or based on groups provided from an authenticator.

When organization mapping is positively evaluated, a specified organization is created, if it does not exist if the authenticator tied to the map is allowed to create objects.

1. After configuring the authentication details for your authentication type, select Organization from the Add authentication mapping list.
2. Enter a unique rule Name to identify the rule.
3. Select a Trigger from the list. See Authenticator map triggers for more information about map triggers.
4. Select Revoke to deny user access to the system when none of the trigger conditions are matched.
5. Select the Organization to which matching users are added or blocked.
6. Select a Role to be applied or removed for matching users (for example, Organization Admin or Organization Member).
7. Click btn:[Next].

[NOTE]
