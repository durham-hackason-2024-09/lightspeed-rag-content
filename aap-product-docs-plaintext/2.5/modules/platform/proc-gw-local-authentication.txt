# Configuring local authentication

As a platform administrator, you can configure local system authentication. With local authentication, users and their passwords are checked against local system accounts.


[NOTE]
----
A local authenticator is automatically created by the Ansible Automation Platform installation process, and is configured with the specified admin credentials in the inventory file before installation. After successful installation, you can log in to the Ansible Automation Platform using those credentials.
