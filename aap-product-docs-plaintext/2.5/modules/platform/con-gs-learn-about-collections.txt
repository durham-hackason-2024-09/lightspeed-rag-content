# Learn about content collections

Ansible content collections are assemblages of automation content.
You can find Ansible Certified Collections in automation hub.

# Browse content

If you are not using the bundle installer, you can use a Red Hat-supplied Ansible Playbook to install validated content. For further information, see Ansible validated content.

You can update validated collections manually by downloading their updated packages in automation hub.
