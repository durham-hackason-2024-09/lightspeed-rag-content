# Control and execution planes

# Control plane



# Execution plane

The execution plane consists of execution nodes that execute automation on behalf of the control plane and have no control functions. Hop nodes serve to communicate. Nodes in the execution plane only run user-space jobs, and may be geographically separated, with high latency, from the control plane.

* Execution nodes - Execution nodes run jobs under ansible-runner with podman isolation. This node type is similar to isolated nodes. This is the default node type for execution plane nodes.
* Hop nodes - similar to a jump host, hop nodes route traffic to other execution nodes. Hop nodes cannot execute automation.
