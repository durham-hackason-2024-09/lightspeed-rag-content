# Uploading the custom execution environment to the private hub

Before the new execution environment image can be used for automation jobs, it must be uploaded to the private automation hub.

First, verify that the execution environment image can be seen in the local podman cache:


```
$ podman images --format "table {{.ID}} {{.Repository}} {{.Tag}}"
IMAGE ID	    REPOSITORY					              TAG
b38e3299a65e	private-hub.example.com/custom-ee     	  latest
8e38be53b486	private-hub.example.com/ee-minimal-rhel8  latest
```


Then log in to the private automation hub&#8217;s container registry and push the image to make it available for use with job templates and workflows:


```
$ podman login private-hub.example.com -u admin
Password:
Login Succeeded!
$ podman push private-hub.example.com/custom-ee:latest
```
