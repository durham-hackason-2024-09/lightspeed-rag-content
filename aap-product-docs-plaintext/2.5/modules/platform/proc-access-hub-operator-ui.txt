# Finding the automation hub route

You can access the automation hub through the platform gateway or through the following procedure.

1. Log into Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Networking[Routes].
3. Under Location, click on the URL for your automation hub instance.

The automation hub user interface launches where you can sign in with the administrator credentials specified during the operator configuration process.


[NOTE]
----
If you did not specify an administrator password during configuration, one was automatically created for you. To locate this password, go to your project, select menu:Workloads[Secrets] and open controller-admin-password. From there you can copy the password and paste it into the Automation hub password field.
