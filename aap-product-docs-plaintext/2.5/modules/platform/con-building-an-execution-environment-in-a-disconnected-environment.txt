# Building an execution environment in a disconnected environment

Creating execution environments for Ansible Automation Platform is a common task which works differently in disconnected environments. When building a custom execution environment, the ansible-builder tool defaults to downloading content from the following locations on the internet:

* Red Hat Automation hub (console.redhat.com) or Ansible Galaxy (galaxy.ansible.com) for any Ansible content collections added to the execution environment image.
* PyPI (pypi.org) for any python packages required as collection dependencies.
* RPM repositories such as the RHEL or UBI repositories (cdn.redhat.com) for adding or updating RPMs to the execution environment image, if needed.
* registry.redhat.io for access to the base container images.

Building an execution environment image in a disconnected environment requires mirroring content from these locations. See Importing Collections into private automation hub for information about importing collections from Ansible Galaxy or automation hub into a private automation hub.

Mirrored PyPI content once transferred into the disconnected network can be made available by using a web server or an artifact repository such as Nexus. The RHEL and UBI repository content can be exported from an internet-facing Red Hat Satellite Server, copied into the disconnected environment, then imported into a disconnected Satellite so it is available for building custom execution environments. See ISS Export Sync in an Air-Gapped Scenario for details.

The default base container image, ee-minimal-rhel8, is used to create custom execution environment images and is included with the bundled installer. This image is added to the private automation hub at install time. If a different base container image such as ee-minimal-rhel9 is required, it must be imported to the disconnected network and added to the private automation hub container registry.

Once all of the prerequisites are available on the disconnected network, the ansible-builder command can be used to create custom execution environment images.
