# Minimize administrative accounts

Minimizing the access to system administrative accounts is crucial for maintaining a secure system.
A system administrator or root user can access, edit, and disrupt any system application.
Limit the number of people or accounts with root access, where possible.
Do not give out sudo to root or awx (the automation controller user) to untrusted users.
Note that when restricting administrative access through mechanisms like sudo, restricting to a certain set of commands can still give a wide range of access.
Any command that enables execution of a shell or arbitrary shell commands, or any command that can change files on the system, is equal to full root access.

With automation controller, any automation controller "system administrator" or "superuser" account can edit, change, and update an inventory or automation definition in automation controller.
Restrict this to the minimum set of users possible for low-level automation controller configuration and disaster recovery only.
