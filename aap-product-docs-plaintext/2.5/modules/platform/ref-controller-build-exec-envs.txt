# Building an execution environment

If your Ansible content depends on custom virtual environments instead of a default environment, you must take additional steps.
You must install packages on each node, interact well with other software installed on the host system, and keep them in synchronization.

To simplify this process, you can build container images that serve as Ansible
Control nodes.
These container images are referred to as automation execution environments, which you can create with ansible-builder.
Ansible-runner can then make use of those images.
