# Using custom Receptor signing keys

Receptor signing is enabled by default unless receptor_disable_signing=true is set, and an RSA key pair (public and private) is generated by the installer. However, you can provide custom RSA public and private keys by setting the path variables:


```
receptor_signing_private_key=<full_path_to_private_key>
receptor_signing_public_key=<full_path_to_public_key>
```
