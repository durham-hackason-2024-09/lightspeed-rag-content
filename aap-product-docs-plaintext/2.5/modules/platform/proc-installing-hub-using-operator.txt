# Installing automation hub using the Ansible Automation Platform Operator

Use the following procedure to install automation hub using the Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operator[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select the Automation hub tab.
5. Click btn:[Create Automation hub].
6. Select btn:[YAML view].
The YAML should be similar to:

```
apiVersion: automationhub.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationHub
metadata:
  name: private-ah                              1
  namespace: aap
spec:
  sso_secret: automation-hub-sso                2
  pulp_settings:
    verify_ssl: false
  route_tls_termination_mechanism: Edge
  ingress_type: Route
  loadbalancer_port: 80
  file_storage_size: 100Gi
  image_pull_policy: IfNotPresent
  replicas: 1                                   3
  web_replicas: N
  task_replicas: N
  file_storage_access_mode: ReadWriteMany
  content:
    log_level: INFO
    replicas: 2
  postgres_storage_requirements:
    limits:
      storage: 50Gi
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
  api:
    log_level: INFO
    replicas: 1
  postgres_resource_requirements:
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m
      memory: 8Gi
    requests:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 2Gi
  loadbalancer_protocol: http
  resource_manager:
    replicas: 1
  worker:
    replicas: 2
```

Set metadata.name to the name to use for the instance.
Set spec.sso_secret to the name of the secret created in Creating a Secret to hold the Red Hat Single Sign On connection details.
Scale replicas up or down for each deployment by using the web_replicas or task_replicas respectively, where N represents the number of replicas you want to create. Alternatively, you can scale all pods across both deployments by using replicas. See Scaling the Web and Task Pods independently for details.

[NOTE]
----
This YAML turns off SSL verification (ssl_verify: false).
If you are not using self-signed certificates for OpenShift this setting can be removed.
