# Fetching platform gateway login details from the OpenShift Container Platform CLI

To login to the platform gateway, you need the web address and the password.

# Fetching the platform gateway web address

A Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform route exposes a service at a host name, so that external clients can reach it by name.
When you created the platform gateway instance, a route was created for it.
The route inherits the name that you assigned to the platform gateway object in the YAML file.

Use the following command to fetch the routes:


```
oc get routes -n <platform_namespace>
```


In the following example, the example platform gateway is running in the ansible-automation-platform namespace.


```
$ oc get routes -n ansible-automation-platform

NAME      HOST/PORT                                              PATH   SERVICES          PORT   TERMINATION     WILDCARD
example   example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing          example-service   http   edge/Redirect   None
```


The address for the platform gateway instance is example-ansible-automation-platform.apps-crc.testing.

# Fetching the platform gateway password

The YAML block for the platform gateway instance in sub.yaml assigns values to the name and admin_user keys.
Use these values in the following command to fetch the password for the platform gateway instance.


```
oc get secret/<your instance name>-<admin_user>-password -o yaml
```


The default value for admin_user is admin. Modify the command if you changed the admin username in sub.yaml.

The following example retrieves the password for a platform gateway object called example:


```
oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml
```


The password for the platform gateway instance is listed in the metadata field in the output:


```
$ oc get secret/example-admin-password -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: ODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzLODzL
kind: Secret

    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: example
  name: example-admin-password
  namespace: ansible-automation-platform
```
