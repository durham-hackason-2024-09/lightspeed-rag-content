# Configuring known proxies

To configure a list of known proxies for your automation controller, add the proxy IP addresses to the Proxy IP Allowed List field in the System Settings page.

2. In the Proxy IP Allowed List field, enter IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your automation controller, following the syntax in the example below:
Example Proxy IP Allowed List entry

```
[
  "example1.proxy.com:8080",
  "example2.proxy.com:8080"
]
```


[IMPORTANT]
----
* Proxy IP Allowed List requires proxies in the list are properly sanitizing header input and correctly setting an X-Forwarded-For value equal to the real source IP of the client. Automation controller can rely on the IP addresses and hostnames in Proxy IP Allowed List to provide non-spoofed values for X-Forwarded-For.`
* Do not configure HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR as an item in Remote Host Headers unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:
* You are using a proxied environment with ssl termination;
* The proxy provides sanitization or validation of the X-Forwarded-For header to prevent client spoofing;
* /etc/tower/conf.d/remote_host_headers.py defines PROXY_IP_ALLOWED_LIST that contains only the originating IP addresses of trusted proxies or load balancers.
