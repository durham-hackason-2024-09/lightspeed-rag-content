# View a listing of all ansible_ variables

By default, Ansible gathers "facts" about the machines under its management, accessible in Playbooks and in templates.

To view all facts available about a machine, run the setup module as an ad hoc action:

ansible -m setup hostname

This prints out a dictionary of all facts available for that particular host.
For more information, see information-discovered-from-systems-facts in the Ansible documentation.
