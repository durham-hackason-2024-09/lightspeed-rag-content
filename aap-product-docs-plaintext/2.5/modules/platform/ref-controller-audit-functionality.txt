# Audit and logging functionality

For any administrative access, it is important to audit and watch for actions.
For the system overall, you can do this through the built-in audit support and the built-in logging support.

For automation controller, you can do this through the built-in Activity Stream support that logs all changes within automation controller, and through the automation logs.

Best practices dictate collecting logging and auditing centrally rather than reviewing it on the local system.
You must configure automation controller to use standard IDs or logging and auditing (Splunk) in your environment.
automation controller includes built-in logging integrations such as Elastic Stack, Splunk, Sumologic, and Loggly.
