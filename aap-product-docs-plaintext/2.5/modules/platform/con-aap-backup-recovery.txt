# About backup and recovery

Red Hat recommends backing up deployments of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform in your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform environment to prevent data loss.

A backup resource of your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployment includes the following:

* Custom deployment of specific values in the spec section of the Ansible Automation Platform custom resource object.
* Back up of the postgresql database.
* secret_key, admin_password, and broadcast_websocket secrets.
* Database configuration.


[NOTE]
----
Be sure to secure your backup resources because they can include sensitive information.
