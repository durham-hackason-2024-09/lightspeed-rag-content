# Isolation functionality and variables

Automation controller uses container technology to isolate jobs from each other.
By default, only the current project is exposed to the container running a job template.

If you need to expose additional directories, you must customize your playbook runs.
To configure job isolation, you can set variables.

By default, automation controller uses the system&#8217;s tmp directory (/tmp by default) as its staging area.
This can be changed in the Job Execution Path field of the Jobs settings page, or in the REST API at /api/v2/settings/jobs:


```
AWX_ISOLATION_BASE_PATH = "/opt/tmp"
```


If there are any additional directories that should specifically be exposed from the host to the container that playbooks run in, you can specify those in the Paths to expose to isolated jobs field of the Jobs Settings page, or in the REST API at /api/v2/settings/jobs:


```
AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS = ['/list/of/', '/paths']
```



[NOTE]
----
If your playbooks need to use keys or settings defined in AWX_ISOLATION_SHOW_PATHS, then add this file to /var/lib/awx/.ssh.

The fields described here can be found on the Jobs settings page:
