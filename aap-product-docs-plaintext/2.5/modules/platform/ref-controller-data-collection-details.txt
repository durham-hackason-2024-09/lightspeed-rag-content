# Details of data collection

Automation Analytics collects the following classes of data from automation controller:

* Basic configuration, such as which features are enabled, and what operating system is being used
* Topology and status of the automation controller environment and hosts, including capacity and health
* Counts of automation resources:
* organizations, teams, and users
* inventories and hosts
* credentials (indexed by type)
* projects (indexed by type)
* templates
* schedules
* active sessions
* running and pending jobs
* Job execution details (start time, finish time, launch type, and success)
* Automation task details (success, host id, playbook/role, task name, and module used)

You can use awx-manage gather_analytics (without --ship) to inspect the data that automation controller sends, so that you can satisfy your data collection concerns.
This creates a tarball that contains the analytics data that is sent to Red Hat.

This file contains a number of JSON and CSV files.
Each file contains a different set of analytics data.
