# Backing up the Automation controller deployment

Use this procedure to back up a deployment of the controller, including jobs, inventories, and credentials.

* You must be authenticated with an OpenShift cluster.
* You have installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator on the cluster.
* You have deployed automation controller using the Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select the Automation Controller Backup tab.
5. Click btn:[Create AutomationControllerBackup].
6. Enter a Name for the backup.
7. Enter the Deployment name of the deployed Ansible Automation Platform instance being backed up.
For example, if your automation controller must be backed up and the deployment name is aap-controller, enter 'aap-controller' in the Deployment name field.
8. If you want to use a custom, pre-created pvc:
1. [Optional]: enter the name of the Backup persistent volume claim.
2. [Optional]: enter the Backup PVC storage requirements, and Backup PVC storage class.

[NOTE]
----
If no pvc or storage class is provided, the cluster's default storage class is used to create the pvc.

3. If you have a large database, specify your storage requests accordingly under Backup management pod resource requirements.

----
You can check the size of the existing postgres database data directory by running the following command inside the postgres pod.

```
$ df -h | grep "/var/lib/pgsql/data"
```

A backup tarball of the specified deployment is created and available for data recovery or deployment rollback. Future backups are stored in separate tar files on the same pvc.

3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator.
4. Select the AutomationControllerBackup tab.
