# Requests and limits for task containers

You must set a value for the task container&#8217;s CPU and memory resource limits.
For each job that is run in an execution node, processing must occur on the control plane to schedule, open, and receive callback events for that job.

For Operator deployments of automation controller, this control plane capacity usage is tracked on the controlplane instance group.
The available capacity is determined based on the limits the user sets on the task container, using the task_resource_requirements field in the automation controller specification, or in the OpenShift UI, when creating automation controller.

You can also set memory and CPU resource limits that make sense for your cluster.
