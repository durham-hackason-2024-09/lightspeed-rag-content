# Completing post installation tasks

After you have completed the installation of Ansible Automation Platform, ensure that automation hub and automation controller deploy properly.

# Adding a controller subscription

1. Navigate to the FQDN of the Automation controller. Log in with the username admin and the password you specified as admin_password in your inventory file.
2. Click btn:[Browse] and select the manifest.zip you created earlier.
3. Click btn:[Next].
4. Uncheck btn:[User analytics] and btn:[Automation analytics]. These rely on an internet connection and must be turned off.
5. Click btn:[Next].
6. Read the End User License Agreement and click btn:[Submit] if you agree.

# Updating the CA trust store

As part of your post-installation tasks, you must update the software&#8217;s certificates.
By default, Ansible Automation Platform automation hub and automation controller are installed using self-signed certificates. Because of this, the controller does not trust the hub’s certificate and will not download the execution environment from the hub.

To ensure that automation controller downloads the execution environment from automation hub, you must import the hub’s Certificate Authority (CA) certificate as a trusted certificate on the controller. You can do this in one of two ways, depending on whether SSH is available as root user between automation controller and private automation hub.

## Using secure copy (SCP) as a root user

If SSH is available as the root user between the controller and private automation hub, use SCP to copy the root certificate on the private automation hub to the controller.

1. Run update-ca-trust on the controller to update the CA trust store:


```
$ sudo -i
# scp <hub_fqdn>:/etc/pulp/certs/root.crt
/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt
# update-ca-trust
```


## Copying and pasting as a non root user

If SSH is unavailable as root between the private automation hub and the controller, copy the contents of the file /etc/pulp/certs/root.crt on the private automation hub and paste it into a new file on the controller called /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt.

1. Run update-ca-trust to update the CA trust store with the new certificate. On the private automation hub, run:


```
$ sudo -i
# cat /etc/pulp/certs/root.crt
(copy the contents of the file, including the lines with 'BEGIN CERTIFICATE' and
'END CERTIFICATE')
```


1. On the automation controller:


```
$ sudo -i
# vi /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/automationhub-root.crt
(paste the contents of the root.crt file from the private automation hub into the new file and write to disk)
# update-ca-trust
```
