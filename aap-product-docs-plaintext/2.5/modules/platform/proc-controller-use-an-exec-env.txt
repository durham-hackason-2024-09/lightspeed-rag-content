# Adding an execution environment to a job template

* An execution environment must have been created using ansible-builder as described in Build an execution environment.
When an execution environment has been created, you can use it to run jobs.
Use the automation controller UI to specify the execution environment to use in your job templates.
* Depending on whether an execution environment is made available for global use or tied to an organization, you must have the appropriate level of administrator privileges to use an execution environment in a job.
Execution environments tied to an organization require Organization administrators to be able to run jobs with those execution environments.
* Before running a job or job template that uses an execution environment that has a credential assigned to it, ensure that the credential contains a username, host, and password.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Execution Environments].
2. Click btn:[Create execution environment] to add an execution environment.
3. Enter the appropriate details into the following fields:
* Name (required): Enter a name for the execution environment.
* Image (required): Enter the image name.
The image name requires its full location (repository), the registry, image name, and version tag in the example format of quay.io/ansible/awx-ee:latestrepo/project/image-name:tag.
* Optional: Pull: Choose the type of pull when running jobs:
* Always pull container before running: Pulls the latest image file for the container.
* Only pull the image if not present before running: Only pulls the latest image if none is specified.
* Never pull container before running: Never pull the latest version of the container image.

[NOTE]
----
If you do not set a type for pull, the value defaults to Only pull the image if not present before running.
----
* Optional: Description:
* Optional: Organization: Assign the organization to specifically use this execution environment. To make the execution environment available for use across multiple organizations, leave this field blank.
* Registry Credential: If the image has a protected container registry, give the credential to access it.
4. Click btn:[Create execution environment].

Your newly added execution environment is ready to be used in a job template.
5. To add an execution environment to a job template, specify it in the Execution Environment field of the job template.

When you have added an execution environment to a job template, those templates are listed in the Templates tab of the execution environment:
