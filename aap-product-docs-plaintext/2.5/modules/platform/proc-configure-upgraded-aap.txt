# Configuring automation controller instance groups

After upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform instance, associate your original instances to its corresponding instance groups by configuring settings in the automation controller UI:

1. Log in to the new Controller instance.
2. Content from old instance, such as credentials, jobs, inventories should now be visible on your Controller instance.
3. Navigate to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Instance Groups].
4. Associate execution nodes by clicking on an instance group, then click the Instances tab.
5. Click btn:[Associate]. Select the node(s) to associate to this instance group, then click btn:[Save].
6. You can also modify the default instance to disassociate your new execution nodes.
