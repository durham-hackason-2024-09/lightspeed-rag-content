# About automation mesh

Automation mesh is an overlay network intended to ease the distribution of work across a large and dispersed collection of workers through nodes that establish peer-to-peer connections with each other using existing networks.

Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2 replaces Ansible Tower and isolated nodes with Ansible Automation Platform and automation hub.
Ansible Automation Platform provides the control plane for automation through its UI, RESTful API, RBAC, workflows and CI/CD integration, while automation mesh can be used for setting up, discovering, changing or modifying the nodes that form the control and execution layers.

Automation mesh uses TLS encryption for communication, so traffic that traverses external networks (the internet or other) is encrypted in transit.

Automation mesh introduces:

* Dynamic cluster capacity that scales independently, enabling you to create, register, group, ungroup and deregister nodes with minimal downtime.
* Control and execution plane separation that enables you to scale playbook execution capacity independently from control plane capacity.
* Deployment choices that are resilient to latency, reconfigurable without outage, and that dynamically re-reroute to choose a different path when outages occur.
* Connectivity that includes bi-directional, multi-hopped mesh communication possibilities which are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant.
