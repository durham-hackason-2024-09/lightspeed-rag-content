# Ansible Automation Platform upgrade planning

Before you begin the upgrade process, review the following considerations to plan and prepare your Ansible Automation Platform deployment:

## Automation controller

* Even if you have a valid license from a previous version, you must provide your credentials or a subscriptions manifest upon upgrading to the latest version of automation controller.
* If you need to upgrade Red Hat Enterprise Linux and automation controller, you must first backup and restore your automation controller data.
* Clustered upgrades require special attention to instance and instance groups before upgrading.

* Importing a subscription
* Backup and restore
* Clustering

## Automation hub

* When upgrading to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, you can either add an existing automation hub API token or generate a new one and invalidate any existing tokens.
* Existing container images are removed when upgrading Ansible Automation Platform.
This is because, when upgrading Ansible Automation Platform with setup.sh script, podman system reset -f is executed.
This removes all container images on your Ansible Automation Platform nodes then pushes the new execution environment image that is bundled with installer.
See Running the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer setup script.

* Setting up the inventory file

## Event-Driven Ansible controller

* If you are currently running Event-Driven Ansible controller and plan to deploy it when you upgrade to Ansible Automation Platform 2.5, it is recommended that you disable all Event-Driven Ansible activations before upgrading to ensure that only new activations run after the upgrade process has completed. This prevents possibilities of orphaned containers running activations from the previous version.
