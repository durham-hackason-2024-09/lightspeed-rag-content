# Obtaining an authorized Ansible automation controller subscription

If you already have a subscription to a Red Hat product, you can acquire an automation controller subscription through that subscription.
If you do not have a subscription to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and Red Hat Satellite, you can request a trial subscription.

* If you have a non-Ansible Red Hat or Satellite subscription, access automation controller with one of these methods:
* Enter your username and password on the license page.
* Obtain a subscriptions manifest from the Subscription Allocations page on the Red Hat Customer Portal.
* If you do not have a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription, go to Try Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform and request a trial subscription.

* If you have issues with your subscription, contact your Sales Account Manager or Red Hat Customer Service at: https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/customerService/.
