# Build and use an execution environment

Automation execution environments are consistent and shareable container images that serve as Ansible control nodes.
Automation execution environments reduce the challenge of sharing Ansible content that has external dependencies.
If automation content is like a script that a developer has written, an automation execution environment is like a replica of that developer&#8217;s environment, thereby enabling you to reproduce and scale the automation content that the developer has written.

Automation execution environmentss make it easier for you to implement automation in a range of environments.
