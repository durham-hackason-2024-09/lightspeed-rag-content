# Capacity job impacts

When selecting the capacity, it is important to understand how each job type affects capacity.

The default forks value for Ansible is five.
However, if you set up automation controller to run against fewer systems than that, then the actual concurrency value is lower.

When a job is run in automation controller, the number of forks selected  is incremented by 1, to compensate for the Ansible parent process.

If you run a playbook against five systems with forks value of 5, then the actual forks value from the Job Impact perspective is 6.
