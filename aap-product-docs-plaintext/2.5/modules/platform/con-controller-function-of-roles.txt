# Function of roles: editing and creating

Organization "resource roles" functionality are specific to a certain resource type - such as workflows.
Being a member of such a role usually provides two types of permissions.
If a user is given a "workflow admin role" for the organization "Default", then they have the following permissions:
* This user can create new workflows in the organization "Default"
* This user can edit all workflows in the "Default" organization
One exception is job templates, where having the role is independent of creation permission.
For more information, see Job Templates.

# Independence of resource roles and organization membership roles

Resource-specific organization roles are independent of the organization roles of administrator and member.
Having the "workflow administrator role" for the "Default" organization does not enable a user to view all users in the organization, but having a "member" role in the "Default" organization does.
The two types of roles are delegated independently of each other.

## Necessary permissions to edit job templates

Users can edit fields not impacting job runs (non-sensitive fields) with a Job Template administrator role alone.
However, to edit fields that impact job runs in a job template, a user must have the following:

* An admin role for the job template and container groups
* A use role for related projects
* A use role for related inventories
* A use role for related instance groups

An "organization job template admin" role was introduced, but having this role is not sufficient by itself to edit a job template within the organization if the user does not have a use role for the project, inventory, or instance group, or an administrator role to the container group that
a job template uses.

To delegate full job template control (within an organization) to a user or team, you must grant the team or user all three organization-level roles:

* job template administrator
* project administrator
* inventory administrator

This ensures that the user (or all users who are members of the team with these roles) has full access to modify job templates in the organization.
If a job template uses an inventory or project from another organization, the user with these organization roles can still not have permission to modify that job template.
For clarity of permission management, do not mix projects or inventories from different organizations.

## RBAC permissions

Each role must have a content object, for instance, the organization administrator role has a content object of the organization.
To delegate a role, you must have administrator permission for the content object, with some exceptions that would result in you being able to reset a user&#8217;s password.

Parent is the organization.

Allow is what this new permission will explicitly allow.

Scope is the parent resource that this new role is created on. For example: Organization.project_create_role.

It is assumed that the creator of the resource is given the administrator role for that resource.
Instances where resource creation does not also imply resource administration are explicitly called out.

The rules associated with each administrator type are as follows:

Project Admin

* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any project
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: Project Add Screen - Organizations

Inventory Admin

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete any inventory
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: Inventory Add Screen - Organizations


[NOTE]
----
As with the Use role, if you assign Project Administrator and Inventory Administrator roles to a user, it enables them to create Job Templates (not workflows) for your organization.
----

Credential Admin

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create, read, update, delete shared credentials
* Scope: Organization
* User Interface: Credential Add Screen - Organizations

Notification Admin

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Assignment of notifications
* Scope: Organization

Workflow Admin

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Create a workflow
* Scope: Organization

Org Execute

* Parent: Org admin
* Allow: Executing job templates and workflow job templates
* Scope: Organization

The following is a sample scenario showing an organization with its
roles and which resources each have access to:
