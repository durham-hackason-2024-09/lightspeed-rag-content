# Changing the SSL certificate and key for automation hub on OpenShift Container Platform

The following procedure describes how to change the SSL certificate and key for automation hub running on OpenShift Container Platform.

1. Copy the signed SSL certificate and key to a secure location.
2. Create a TLS secret within OpenShift:

```
oc create secret tls ${AUTOMATION_HUB_INSTANCE}-certs-$(date +%F) --cert=/path/to/ssl.crt --key=/path/to/ssl.key
```

3. Modify the automation hub custom resource to add route_tls_secret and the name of the new secret to the spec section.

```
oc edit automationhub/${AUTOMATION_HUB_INSTANCE}
```


```
...
spec:
  route_tls_secret: automation-hub-certs-2023-04-06
...
```


The name of the TLS secret is arbitrary.
In this example, it is timestamped with the date that the secret is created, to differentiate it from other TLS secrets applied to the automation hub instance.

1. Wait a few minutes for the changes to be applied.
2. Verify that new SSL certificate and key have been installed:

```
true | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ${CONTROLLER_FQDN}:443
```
