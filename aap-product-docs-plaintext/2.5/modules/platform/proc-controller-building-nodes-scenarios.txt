# Building nodes scenarios

Learn how to manage nodes in the following scenarios.

* Click the () icon on the parent node to add a sibling node:

![Create sibling node]

* Hover over the line that connects two nodes and click the plus (), to insert another node in between nodes.
Clicking the plus () icon automatically inserts the node between the two nodes:

![Insert node template]

* Click btn:[START] again, to add a root node to depict a split scenario:

![Node split scenario]

* At any node where you want to create a split scenario, hover over the node from which the split scenario begins and click the plus () icon.
This adds multiple nodes from the same parent node, creating sibling nodes:

![Node create siblings]
