# Deploying the platform gateway with existing Ansible Automation Platform components

The following procedure simulates a scenario where you have automation controller as an existing component and want to add automation hub and Event-Driven Ansible.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Click btn:[Subscriptions] and edit your Update channel to stable-2.5.
5. Click btn:[Details] and on the Ansible Automation Platform tile click btn:[Create instance].
6. From the Create Ansible Automation Platform page enter a name for your instance in the Name field.
7. Click btn:[YAML view] and copy in the following:

```
    apiVersion: aap.ansible.com/v1alpha1
        kind: AnsibleAutomationPlatform
        metadata:
          name: example-aap
          namespace: aap
        spec:
          # Platform
          image_pull_policy: IfNotPresent
          # Components
          controller:
            disabled: false
            name: existing-controller-name
          eda:
            disabled: false
          hub:
            disabled: false
            ## uncomment if using file storage for Content pod
            storage_type: file
            file_storage_storage_class: your-rwx-storage-class
            file_storage_size: 10Gi

            ## uncomment if using S3 storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: S3
            # object_storage_s3_secret: example-galaxy-object-storage

            ## uncomment if using Azure storage for Content pod
            # storage_type: azure
            # object_storage_azure_secret: azure-secret-name
          lightspeed:
            disabled: true
```

1. For new components, if you do not specify a name, a default name is generated.
8. Click btn:[Create].
9. To access your new instance, see .


[NOTE]
----
If you have an existing controller with a managed Postgres pod, after creating the Ansible Automation Platform resource your automation controller instance will continue to use that original Postgres pod. If you were to do a fresh install you would have a single Postgres managed pod for all instances.
