# Running jobs on execution nodes

You must specify where jobs are run, or they default to running in the control cluster.

To do this, set up a Job Template.

For more information on Job Templates, see Job Templates in Using automation execution.

1. The Templates list view shows job templates that are currently available.
From this screen you can launch , edit , and copy  a workflow job template.
2. Select the job you want and click the  icon.
3. Select the Instance Group on which you want to run the job.
Note that a System Administrator must grant you or your team permissions to be able to use an instance group in a job template.
If you select multiple jobs templates, the order in which you select them sets the execution precedence.
