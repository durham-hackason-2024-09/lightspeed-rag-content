# Change the automation controller Administrator Password

During the installation process, you are prompted to enter an administrator password that is used for the admin superuser or system administrator created by automation controller.
If you log in to the instance by using SSH, it tells you the default administrator password in the prompt.

If you need to change this password at any point, run the following command as root on the automation controller server:

awx-manage changepassword admin

Next, enter a new password.
After that, the password you have entered works as the administrator password in the web UI.

To set policies at creation time for password validation using Django, see Django password policies.
