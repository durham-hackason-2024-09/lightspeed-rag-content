# Changing the SSL certificate and key on automation controller on OpenShift Container Platform

The following procedure describes how to change the SSL certificate and key for automation controller running on OpenShift Container Platform.

1. Copy the signed SSL certificate and key to a secure location.
2. Create a TLS secret within OpenShift:

```
oc create secret tls ${CONTROLLER_INSTANCE}-certs-$(date +%F) --cert=/path/to/ssl.crt --key=/path/to/ssl.key
```

3. Modify the automation controller custom resource to add route_tls_secret and the name of the new secret to the spec section.

```
oc edit automationcontroller/${CONTROLLER_INSTANCE}
```


```
...
spec:
  route_tls_secret: automation-controller-certs-2023-04-06
...
```


The name of the TLS secret is arbitrary.
In this example, it is timestamped with the date that the secret is created, to differentiate it from other TLS secrets applied to the automation controller instance.

1. Wait a few minutes for the changes to be applied.
2. Verify that new SSL certificate and key have been installed:

```
true | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect ${CONTROLLER_FQDN}:443
```
