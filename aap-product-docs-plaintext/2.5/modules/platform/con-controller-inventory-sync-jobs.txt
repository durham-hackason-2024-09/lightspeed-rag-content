# Inventory sync jobs

When an inventory synchronization is executed, the results display in the Output tab.

For more information on inventory synchronization, see Constructed inventories.

If used, the Ansible CLI displays the same information.
This can be useful for debugging.
The ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT parameter is set to False for all playbook runs.
This parameter matches Ansible&#8217;s default behavior and does not display task arguments in task headers in the Job Detail interface to avoid leaking certain sensitive module parameters to stdout.
To restore the previous behavior, set ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT to True through the AWX_TASK_ENV configuration setting.

For more information, see ANSIBLE_DISPLAY_ARGS_TO_STDOUT in the ansible documentation.

Use the icons to relaunch , download  the job output, or delete  the job.

[NOTE]
----
You can perform an inventory update while a related job is running.
In cases where you have a large project (around 10 GB), disk space on /tmp can be an issue.
