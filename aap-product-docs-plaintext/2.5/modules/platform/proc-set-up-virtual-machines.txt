# Setting up Virtual Machines for use in an automation mesh

1. SSH into each of the RHEL instances and perform the following steps.
Depending on your network access and controls, SSH proxies or other access models might be required.

Use the following command:

```
ssh [username]@[host_ip_address]
```


For example, for an Ansible Automation Platform instance running on Amazon Web Services.

```
ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.6
```

2. Create or copy an SSH key that can be used to connect from the hop node to the execution node in later steps.
This can be a temporary key used just for the automation mesh configuration, or a long-lived key.
The SSH user and key are used in later steps.
3. Enable your RHEL subscription with baseos and appstream repositories.
Ansible Automation Platform RPM repositories are only available through subscription-manager, not the Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI).
If you attempt to use any other Linux footprint, including RHEL with RHUI, this causes errors.

```
sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach
```


If Simple Content Access is enabled for your account, use:

```
sudo subscription-manager register
```


For more information about Simple Content Access, see Getting started with simple content access.
4. Enable Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions and the proper Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform channel:

For RHEL 8

```
# subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
```


For RHEL 9

```
# subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
```


For ARM

```
# subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-aarch64-rpms
```

5. Ensure the packages are up to date:

```
sudo dnf upgrade -y
```

6. Install the ansible-core packages on the machine where the downloaded bundle is to run:

```
sudo dnf install -y ansible-core
```


[NOTE]
----
Ansible core is required on the machine that runs the automation mesh configuration bundle playbooks.  This document assumes that happens on the execution node.
However, this step can be omitted if you run the playbook from a different machine.
You cannot run directly from the control node, this is not currently supported, but future support expects that the control node has direct connectivity to the execution node.
