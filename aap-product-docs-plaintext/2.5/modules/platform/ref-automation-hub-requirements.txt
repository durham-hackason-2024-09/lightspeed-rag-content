# Automation hub system requirements

Automation hub enables you to discover and use new certified automation content from Red Hat Ansible and Certified Partners. On Ansible automation hub, you can discover and manage Ansible Collections, which are supported automation content developed by Red Hat and its partners for use cases such as cloud automation, network automation, and security automation.

Automation hub has the following system requirements:




[NOTE]
----
Private automation hub
If you install private automation hub from an internal address, and have a certificate which only encompasses the external address, this can result in an installation which cannot be used as container registry without certificate issues.
To avoid this, use the automationhub_main_url inventory variable with a value such as https://pah.example.com linking to the private automation hub node in the installation inventory file.
This adds the external address to /etc/pulp/settings.py.
This implies that you only want to use the external address.
For information about inventory file variables, see Inventory file variables in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide.
