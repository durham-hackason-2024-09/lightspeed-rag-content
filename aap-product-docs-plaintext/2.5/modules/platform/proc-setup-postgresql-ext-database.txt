# Setting up an external (customer supported) database


[IMPORTANT]
----
Red Hat does not support the use of external (customer supported) databases, however they are used by customers.
The following guidance on inital configuration, from a product installation perspective only, is provided to avoid related support requests.
----

To create a database, user and password on an external PostgreSQL compliant database for use with automation controller, use the following procedure.

1. Install and then connect to a PostgreSQL compliant database server with superuser privileges.

```
# psql -h <db.example.com> -U superuser -p 5432 -d postgres <Password for user superuser>:
```


Where:

```
-h hostname
--host=hostname
```


Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running.
If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix-domain socket.

```
-d dbname
--dbname=dbname
```


Specifies the name of the database to connect to.
This is equivalent to specifying dbname as the first non-option argument on the command line.
The dbname can be a connection string.
If so, connection string parameters override any conflicting command line options.

```
-U username
--username=username
```


Connect to the database as the user username instead of the default. (You must have permission to do so.)
2. Create the user, database, and password with the createDB or administrator role assigned to the user.
For further information, see Database Roles.
3. Add the database credentials and host details to the automation controller inventory file as an external database.

The default values are used in the following example.

```
[database]
pg_host='db.example.com'
pg_port=5432
pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='redhat'
```

4. Run the installer.

If you are using a PostgreSQL database with automation controller, the database is owned by the connecting user and must have a createDB or administrator role assigned to it.
5. Check that you are able to connect to the created database with the user, password and database name.
6. Check the permission of the user, the user should have the createDB or administrator role.


[NOTE]

During this procedure, you must check the External Database coverage. For further information, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/4010491
