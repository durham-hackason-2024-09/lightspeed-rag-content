# Using custom TLS certificates

By default, the installer generates TLS certificates and keys for all services that are signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA). You can provide a custom TLS certificate and key for each service. If that certificate is signed by a custom CA, you must provide the CA TLS certificate and key.

* Certificate Authority


```
ca_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
ca_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* Platform gateway


```
gateway_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
gateway_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* Automation controller


```
controller_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
controller_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* Automation hub


```
hub_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
hub_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* Event-Driven Ansible


```
eda_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
eda_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* PostgreSQL


```
postgresql_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
postgresql_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```


* Receptor


```
receptor_tls_cert=/full/path/to/tls/certificate
receptor_tls_key=/full/path/to/tls/key
```
