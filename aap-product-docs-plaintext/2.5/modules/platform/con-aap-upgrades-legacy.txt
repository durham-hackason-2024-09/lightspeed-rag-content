# Ansible Automation Platform legacy upgrades

Upgrading to version 2.5 from Ansible Automation Platform 2.0 or earlier requires you to migrate Ansible content for compatibility.

The following steps provide an overview of the legacy upgrade process:

* Duplicate your custom virtual environments into automation execution environments by using the awx-manage command.
* Migrate data from isolated legacy nodes to execution nodes by performing a side-by-side upgrade so nodes are compatible with the latest automation mesh features.
* Import or generate a new automation hub API token.
* Reconfigure your Ansible content to include Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN) for compatibility with ansible-core 2.16.
