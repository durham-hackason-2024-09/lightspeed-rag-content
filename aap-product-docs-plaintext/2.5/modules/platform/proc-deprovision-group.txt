# Deprovisioning groups using the installer

You can deprovision entire groups from your automation mesh using the Ansible Automation Platform installer. Running the installer will remove all configuration files and logs attached to the nodes in the group.

[NOTE]
----
You can deprovision any hosts in your inventory except for the first host specified in the [automationcontroller] group.
----
* Add node_state=deprovision to the [group:vars] associated with the group you want to deprovision.

```
[execution_nodes]
execution-node-1.example.com peers=execution-node-2.example.com
execution-node-2.example.com peers=execution-node-3.example.com
execution-node-3.example.com peers=execution-node-4.example.com
execution-node-4.example.com peers=execution-node-5.example.com
execution-node-5.example.com peers=execution-node-6.example.com
execution-node-6.example.com peers=execution-node-7.example.com
execution-node-7.example.com

[execution_nodes:vars]
node_state=deprovision
```

# Deprovisioning isolated instance groups

You have the option to manually remove any isolated instance groups using the awx-manage deprovisioning utility.


[WARNING]
----
Use the deprovisioning command to only remove isolated instance groups. To deprovision instance groups from your automation mesh architecture, use the installer method instead.
----

* Run the following command, replacing <name> with the name of the instance group:

```
$ awx-manage unregister_queue --queuename=<name>
```
