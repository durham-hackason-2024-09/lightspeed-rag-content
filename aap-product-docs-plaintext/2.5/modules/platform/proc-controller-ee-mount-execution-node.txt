# Mounting the directory in the execution node to the execution environment container

With Ansible Automation Platform 2.1.2, only O and z options were available.
Since Ansible Automation Platform 2.2, further options such as rw are available.
This is useful when using NFS storage.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Job].
2. Edit the Paths to expose to isolated jobs field:
* Enter a list of paths that volumes are mounted from the execution node or the hybrid node to the container.
* Enter one path per line.
* The supported format is HOST-DIR[:CONTAINER-DIR[:OPTIONS].
The allowed paths are z, O, ro, and rw.
Example

```
[
  "/var/lib/awx/.ssh:/root/.ssh:O"
]
```

* For the rw option, configure the SELinux label correctly.
For example, to mount the /foo directory, complete the following commands:

```
sudo su
```


```
mkdir /foo
```


```
chmod 777 /foo
```


```
semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "/foo(/.*)?"
```


```
restorecon -vvFR /foo
```


The awx user must be permitted to read or write in this directory at least.
Set the permissions as 777 at this time.

For more information about mount volumes, see the --volume option of the podman-run(1) section of the Podman documentation.
