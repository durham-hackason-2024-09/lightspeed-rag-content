# Nested groups

A nested group consists of two groups where one is a child of the other.
In the following example, the child group has another host inside of it, and the parent group has a variable defined.

Because of the way Ansible core operates, the variable of the parent group is available in the namespace as a playbook is running, and can be used for
filtering.

The following example inventory file, nested.yml is in YAML format:

all:
  children:
    groupA:
      vars:
        filter_var: filter_val
      children:
        groupB:
          hosts:
            host1: {}
    ungrouped:
      hosts:
        host2: {}

Because host1 is in groupB, it is also in groupA.

Use the following YAML format to filter on nested group names:

`source_vars`:

plugin: constructed

`limit`: `groupA`

Use the following YAML format to filter on a group variable, even if the host is indirectly a member of that group.

In the inventory content, note that host2 is not expected to have the variable filter_var defined, because it is not in any of the groups.
Because strict: true is used, use a default value so that hosts without that variable are defined.
Using this, host2, returns false from the expression, instead of producing an error.
host1 inherits the variable from its groups, and is returned.

source_vars:

plugin: constructed
strict: true
groups:
  filter_var_is_filter_val: filter_var | default("") == "filter_val"

limit: filter_var_is_filter_val
