# Automation controller system requirements

Automation controller is a distributed system, where different software components can be co-located or deployed across multiple compute nodes.
In the installer, four node types are provided as abstractions to help you design the topology appropriate for your use case: control, hybrid, execution, and hop nodes.

Use the following recommendations for node sizing:


[NOTE]
----
On control and hybrid nodes, allocate a minimum of 20 GB to /var/lib/awx for execution environment storage.
----

Execution nodes

Execution nodes run automation. Increase memory and CPU to increase capacity for running more forks.


[NOTE]
----
* The RAM and CPU resources stated might not be required for packages installed on an execution node but are the minimum recommended to handle the job load for a node to run an average number of jobs simultaneously.
* Recommended RAM and CPU node sizes are not supplied.
The required RAM or CPU depends directly on the number of jobs you are running in that environment.
For further information about required RAM and CPU levels, see Performance tuning for automation controller.
----



Control nodes

Control nodes process events and run cluster jobs including project updates and cleanup jobs. Increasing CPU and memory can help with job event processing.



Hop nodes

Hop nodes serve to route traffic from one part of the automation mesh to another (for example, a hop node could be a bastion host into another network). RAM can affect throughput, CPU activity is low. Network bandwidth and latency are generally a more important factor than either RAM or CPU.



* Actual RAM requirements vary based on how many hosts automation controller will manage simultaneously (which is controlled by the forks parameter in the job template or the system ansible.cfg file).
To avoid possible resource conflicts, Ansible recommends 1 GB of memory per 10 forks and 2 GB reservation for automation controller. For more information, see Automation controller capacity determination and job impact. If forks is set to 400, 42 GB of memory is recommended.
* Automation controller hosts check if umask is set to 0022. If not, the setup fails. Set umask=0022 to avoid this error.
* A larger number of hosts can be addressed, but if the fork number is less than the total host count, more passes across the hosts are required. You can avoid these RAM limitations by using any of the following approaches:
* Use rolling updates.
* Use the provisioning callback system built into automation controller, where each system requesting configuration enters a queue and is processed as quickly as possible.
* In cases where automation controller is producing or deploying images such as AMIs.
