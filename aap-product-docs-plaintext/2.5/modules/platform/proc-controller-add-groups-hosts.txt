# Adding new groups and hosts

Groups are only applicable to standard inventories and are not configurable directly through a Smart Inventory.
You can associate an existing group through hosts that are used with standard inventories.
For more information, see Adding groups to inventories in Using automation execution.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Inventories].
2. To add new groups, select the Groups tab and click btn:[Add].
3. To add new hosts to groups, select the Hosts tab and click btn:[Add].

As part of the initial setup and to test that automation controller is set up properly, a local host is added for your use.

![localhost]

If the organization that you created has a group of web server hosts supporting a particular application, complete the following steps:

1. Create a group and add the web server hosts, to add these hosts to the inventory.
2. Click btn:[Cancel] (if you made no changes) or use the breadcrumb navigational links at the top of the automation controller browser to return to the Inventories list view. Clicking btn:[Save] does not exit the Details dialog.
