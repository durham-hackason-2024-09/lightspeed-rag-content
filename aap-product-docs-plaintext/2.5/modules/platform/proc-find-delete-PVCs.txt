# Finding and deleting PVCs

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a storage volume used to store data that automation hub and automation controller applications use. These PVCs are independent from the applications and remain even when the application is deleted. If you are confident that you no longer need a PVC, or have backed it up elsewhere, you can manually delete them.

1. List the existing PVCs in your deployment namespace:

```
oc get pvc -n <namespace>
```

2. Identify the PVC associated with your previous deployment by comparing the old deployment name and the PVC name.
3. Delete the old PVC:

```
oc delete pvc -n <namespace> <pvc-name>
```
