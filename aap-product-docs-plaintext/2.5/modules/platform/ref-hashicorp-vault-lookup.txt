LDAP authentication requires LDAP to be configured in HashiCorp&#8217;s Vault UI and a policy added to the user.
Cubbyhole is the name of the default secret mount.
If you have proper permissions, you can create other mounts and write key values to those.

To test the lookup, create another credential that uses Hashicorp Vault lookup.
