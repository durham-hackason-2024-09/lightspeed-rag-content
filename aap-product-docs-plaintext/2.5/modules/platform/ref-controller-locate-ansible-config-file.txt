# Locate and configure the Ansible configuration file

While Ansible does not require a configuration file, OS packages often include a default one in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg for possible customization.

To use a custom ansible.cfg file, place it at the root of your project.
Automation controller runs ansible-playbook from the root of the project directory, where it finds the custom ansible.cfg file.


[NOTE]
----
An ansible.cfg file anywhere else in the project is ignored.

To learn which values you can use in this file, see Generating a sample ansible.cfg file in the Ansible documentation.

Using the defaults are acceptable for starting out, but you can configure the default module path or connection type here, as well as other things.

Automation controller overrides some ansible.cfg options.
For example, automation controller stores the SSH ControlMaster sockets, the SSH agent socket, and any other per-job run items in a per-job temporary directory that is passed to the container used for job execution.
