# Creating a new application

When integrating an external web application with automation controller the web application might need to create OAuth2 Tokens on behalf of users of the web application.
Creating an application with the Authorization Code grant type is the preferred way to do this for the following reasons:

* External applications can obtain a token for users, using their credentials.
* Compartmentalized tokens issued for a particular application, enables those tokens to be easily managed.
For example, revoking all tokens associated with that application.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[OAuth Applications].
2. Click btn:[Create application].
The Create Application page opens.
3. Enter the following details:
* Name (required): give a name for the application you want to create
* Optional: Description: give a short description for your application
* Organization (required): give an organization with which this application is associated
* Authorization grant type (required): select one of the grant types to use for the user to get tokens for this application.
For more information, see Application using password grant type section of the Configuring automation execution.
* Client Type (required): select the level of security of the client device.
* Redirect URIS: give a list of allowed URIs, separated by spaces.
You need this if you specified the grant type to be Authorization code.
4. Click btn:[Create application], or click btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.

The client ID displays in a window.
