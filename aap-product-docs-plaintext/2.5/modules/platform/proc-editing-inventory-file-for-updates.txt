# Setting up the inventory file

Before upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation, edit the inventory file so that it matches your desired configuration.
You can keep the same parameters from your existing Ansible Automation Platform deployment or you can modify the parameters to match any changes to your environment.

1. Navigate to the installation program directory.
Bundled installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-bundle-2.4-1-x86_64
```

Online installer:: 

```
$ cd ansible-automation-platform-setup-2.4-1
```

2. Open the inventory file for editing.
3. Modify the inventory file to provision new nodes, deprovision nodes or groups, and import or generate automation hub API tokens.

You can use the same inventory file from an existing Ansible Automation Platform 2.1 installation if there are no changes to the environment.

[NOTE]
----
Provide a reachable IP address or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the [automationhub] and [automationcontroller] hosts to ensure that users can synchronize and install content from Ansible automation hub from a different node.
Do not use localhost.
If localhost is used, the upgrade will be stopped as part of preflight checks.
----

* Add new nodes alongside existing nodes in the inventory file as follows:

```ini
[controller]
clusternode1.example.com
clusternode2.example.com
clusternode3.example.com

[all:vars]
admin_password='password'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='<database_name>'
pg_username='<your_username>'
pg_password='<your_password>'
```


* Append node_state-deprovision to the node or group within the inventory file.

When upgrading from Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.0 or earlier to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2.1 or later, you can use your existing automation hub API token or generate a new token. In the inventory file, edit one of the following fields before running the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installer setup script setup.sh:

* Import an existing API token with the automationhub_api_token flag as follows:

```
automationhub_api_token=<api_token>
```

* Generate a new API token, and invalidate any existing tokens, with the generate_automationhub_token flag as follows:

```
generate_automationhub_token=True
```
