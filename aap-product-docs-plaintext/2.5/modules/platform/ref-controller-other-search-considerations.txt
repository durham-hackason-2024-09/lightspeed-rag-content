# Other search considerations

Be aware of the following issues when searching in automation controller:

* There is currently no supported syntax for OR queries.
All search terms are ANDed in the query parameters.
* The left part of a search parameter can be wrapped in quotes
to support searching for strings with spaces. For more information, see Rules for searching.
* Currently, the values in the Fields are direct attributes expected to be returned in a GET request.
Whenever you search against one of the values, automation controller carries out an __icontains search.
So, for example, name:localhost sends back ?name__icontains=localhost.
Automation controller currently performs this search for every Field value, even id.
