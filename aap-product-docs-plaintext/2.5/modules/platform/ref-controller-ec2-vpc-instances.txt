# Viewing private EC2 VPC instances in the automation controller inventory

By default, automation controller only shows instances in a VPC that have an Elastic IP (EIP) associated with them.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Inventories].
2. Select the inventory that has the Source set to Amazon EC2, and click the Source tab.
In the Source Variables field, enter:

vpc_destination_variable: private_ip_address
3. Click btn:[Save] and trigger an update of the group.

Once this is done you can see your VPC instances.


[NOTE]
----
Automation controller must be running inside the VPC with access to those instances if you want to configure them.
