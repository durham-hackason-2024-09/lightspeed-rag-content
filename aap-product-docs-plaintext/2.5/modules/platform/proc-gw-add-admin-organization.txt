# Adding an administrator to an organization

You can add administrators to an organization which allows them to manage the membership and settings of the organization. For example, they can create new users and teams within the organization, and grant permission to users within the organization.
To add an administrator to an organization, the user must already exist.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Organizations].
2. From the Organizations list view, select the organization to which you want to add a user, administrator, or team.
3. Click the Administrators tab.
4. Click btn:[Add administrators].
5. Select the users from the list by clicking the checkbox next to the name to assign the administrator role to them for this organization.
6. Click btn:[Save].
7. To remove a particular administrator from the organization, select Remove administrator from the &#8942; list next to the administrator name. This launches a confirmation dialog, asking you to confirm the removal.

[NOTE]
----
If the user had previously been added as a member to this organization, they will continue to be a member of this organization. However, if they were added to the organization when the administrator assignment was made, they will be removed from the organization.
