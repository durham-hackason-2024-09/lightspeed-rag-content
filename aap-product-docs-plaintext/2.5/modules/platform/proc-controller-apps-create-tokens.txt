# Adding tokens

You can view a list of users that have tokens to access an application by selecting the Tokens tab in the applications Details page.

Configure authentication tokens for your users.
You can select the application to which the token is associated and the level of access that the token has.


[IMPORTANT]
----
You can only create OAuth 2 Tokens for your user through the API or UI, which means you can only access your own user profile to configure or view your tokens.
----

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Users].
2. Select the user for which you want to configure the OAuth 2 tokens.
3. Select the Tokens tab on the user's profile.

When no tokens are present, the Tokens screen prompts you to add them.
4. Click btn:[Create token] to open the Create Token window.
5. Enter the following details:
* Application: enter the name of the application with which you want to associate your token.
You can also search for it by clicking the  icon.
This opens a separate window that enables you to choose from the available options.
Use the Search bar to filter by name if the list is extensive.
Leave this field blank if you want to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) that is not linked to any application.
* Optional: Description: give a short description for your token.
* Scope (required): specify the level of access you want this token to have.
6. Click btn:[Create token], or click btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.

After you save the token, the newly created token for the user is displayed with the token information and when it expires.
7. To view the application to which the token is associated and the token expiration date, go to the token list view.

To verify that the application now shows the user with the appropriate token, open the Tokens tab of the Applications window.

If you are a system administrator and have to create or remove tokens for other users, see the revoke and create commands in the
Token and session management section of the Configuring automation execution.
