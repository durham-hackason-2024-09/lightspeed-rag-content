# Execution environment mount options

Rebuilding an execution environment is one way to add certificates, but inheriting certificates from the host provides a more convenient solution.
For VM-based installations, automation controller automatically mounts the system truststore in the execution environment when jobs run.

You can customize execution environment mount options and mount paths in the Paths to expose to isolated jobs field of the Job Settings page, where Podman-style volume mount syntax is supported.

For more information, see the Podman documentation.
