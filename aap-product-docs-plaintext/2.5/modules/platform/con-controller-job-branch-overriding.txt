# Job branch overriding

Projects specify the branch, tag, or reference to use from source control in the scm_branch field.
These are represented by the values specified in the Type Details fields:

![Project branching emphasized]

When creating or editing a job you have the option to Allow Branch Override.
When this option is checked, project administrators can delegate branch selection to the job templates that use that project, requiring only project use_role.
