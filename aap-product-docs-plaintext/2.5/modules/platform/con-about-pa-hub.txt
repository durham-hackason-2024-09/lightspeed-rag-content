# Private automation hub

Private automation hub provides both disconnected and on-premise solutions for synchronizing content.
You can synchronize collections and execution environment images from Red Hat cloud automation hub, storing and serving your own custom automation collections and execution images.
You can also use other sources such as Ansible Galaxy or other container registries to provide content to your private automation hub.
Private automation hub can integrate into your enterprise directory and your CI/CD pipelines.
