# Existing security functionality

Do not disable SELinux or automation controller&#8217;s existing multi-tenant containment.
Use automation controller&#8217;s role-based access control (RBAC) to delegate the minimum level of privileges required to run automation.
Use teams in automation controller to assign permissions to groups of users rather than to users individually.

For more information, see Role-Based Access Controls in Using automation execution.
