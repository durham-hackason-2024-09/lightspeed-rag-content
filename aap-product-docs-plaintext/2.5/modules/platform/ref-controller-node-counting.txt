# Node counting in licenses

The automation controller license defines the number of Managed Nodes that can be managed as part of a Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription.

A typical license says "License Count: 500", which sets the maximum number of Managed Nodes at 500.

For more information about managed node requirements for licensing, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/3331481.


[NOTE]
----
Ansible does not recycle node counts or reset automated hosts.
