# Use callback plugins with automation controller

Ansible has a flexible method of handling actions during playbook runs, called callback plugins.
You can use these plugins with automation controller to do things such as notify services upon playbook runs or failures, or send
emails after every playbook run.

For official documentation on the callback plugin architecture, see Developing plugins.


[NOTE]
----
Automation controller does not support the stdout callback plugin because Ansible only permits one, and it is already being used for streaming event data.
----

You might also want to review some example plugins, which should be modified for site-specific purposes, such as those available at: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/lib/ansible/plugins/callback

To use these plugins, put the callback plugin .py file into a directory called /callback_plugins alongside your playbook in your automation controller Project.
Then, specify their paths (one path per line) in the Ansible Callback Plugins field of the Job settings:




[NOTE]
----
To have most callbacks shipped with Ansible applied globally, you must add them to the callback_whitelist section of your ansible.cfg.
If you have custom callbacks, see Enabling callback plugins.
