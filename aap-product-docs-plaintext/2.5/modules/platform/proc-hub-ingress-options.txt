# Configuring the ingress type for your automation hub operator

The Ansible Automation Platform Operator installation form allows you to further configure your automation hub operator ingress under Advanced configuration.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Select the Automation Hub tab.
5. For new instances, click btn:[Create AutomationHub].
1. For existing instances, you can edit the YAML view by clicking the &#8942; icon and then btn:[Edit AutomationHub].
6. Click btn:[Advanced Configuration].
7. Under Ingress type, click the drop-down menu and select Ingress.
8. Under Ingress annotations, enter any annotations to add to the ingress.
9. Under Ingress TLS secret, click the drop-down menu and select a secret from the list.

After you have configured your automation hub operator, click btn:[Create] at the bottom of the form view. Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will now create the pods. This may take a few minutes.

You can view the progress by navigating to menu:Workloads[Pods] and locating the newly created instance.

Verify that the following operator pods provided by the Ansible Automation Platform Operator installation from automation hub are running:




[NOTE]
----
A missing pod can indicate the need for a pull secret. Pull secrets are required for protected or private image registries. See Using image pull secrets for more information. You can diagnose this issue further by running oc describe pod <pod-name> to see if there is an ImagePullBackOff error on that pod.
