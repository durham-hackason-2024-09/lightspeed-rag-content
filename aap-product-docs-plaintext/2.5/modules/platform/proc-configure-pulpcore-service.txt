# Configuring pulpcore.service

After you have configured the inventory file, and applied the SELinux context, you now need to configure the pulp service.

1. With the two mount points set up, shut down the Pulp service to configure pulpcore.service:

```
$ systemctl stop pulpcore.service
```

2. Edit pulpcore.service using systemctl:

```
$ systemctl edit pulpcore.service
```

3. Add the following entry to pulpcore.service to ensure that automation hub services starts only after starting the network and mounting the remote mount points:

```
[Unit]
After=network.target var-lib-pulp.mount
```

4. Enable remote-fs.target:

```
$ systemctl enable remote-fs.target
```

5. Reboot the system:

```
$ systemctl reboot
```


A bug in the pulpcore SELinux policies can cause the token authentication public/private keys in etc/pulp/certs/ to not have the proper SELinux labels, causing the pulp process to fail. When this occurs, run the following command to temporarily attach the proper labels:


```
$ chcon system_u:object_r:pulpcore_etc_t:s0 /etc/pulp/certs/token_{private,public}_key.pem
```


Repeat this command to reattach the proper SELinux labels whenever you relabel your system.
