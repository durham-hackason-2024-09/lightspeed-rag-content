# Edit Users

When editing a user, an automation controller system administrator can specify the user as being either a System Administrator (also referred to as the Superuser) or a System Auditor:

* System administrators implicitly inherit all capabilities (read/write/execute) for all objects within the environment.
* System Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects within the environment.
