# Unable to login to automation controller through HTTP

Access to automation controller is intentionally restricted through a secure protocol (HTTPS).
In cases where your configuration is set up to run an automation controller node behind a load balancer or proxy as "HTTP only", and you only want to access it without SSL (for troubleshooting, for example), you must add the following settings in the custom.py file located at /etc/tower/conf.d of your automation controller instance:

SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False

If you change these settings to false it enables automation controller to manage cookies and login sessions when using the HTTP protocol.
You must do this on every node of a cluster installation.

To apply the changes, run:

automation-controller-service restart
