* If restoring to a new cluster, ensure that the old cluster is shut down before proceeding because they can conflict with each other when accessing the database.
* Per-node backups are only restored to nodes bearing the same hostname as the backup.
* When restoring to an existing cluster, the restore contains the following:
* A dump of the PostgreSQL database
* UI artifacts, included in the database dump
* An automation controller configuration (retrieved from /etc/tower)
* An automation controller secret key
* Manual projects
