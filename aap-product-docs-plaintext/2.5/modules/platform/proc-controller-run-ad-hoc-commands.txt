# Running Ad Hoc commands

Ad hoc refers to using Ansible to perform a quick command, using /usr/bin/ansible, rather than the orchestration language, which is /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.
An example of an ad hoc command might be rebooting 50 machines in your infrastructure.
Anything you can do ad hoc can be accomplished by writing a playbook.
Playbooks can also glue many other operations together.

Use the following procedure to run an ad hoc command:

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Inventories].
2. Select the inventory name you want to run an ad hoc command with.
3. Select an inventory source from the Hosts or Groups tab.
The inventory source can be a single group or host, a selection of many hosts, or a selection of many groups.
4. Click btn:[Run Command].
The Run command window opens.
5. Enter the following information:
* Module: Select one of the modules that the supports running commands against.

* Arguments: Provide arguments to be used with the module you selected.
* Limit: Enter the limit used to target hosts in the inventory.
To target all hosts in the inventory enter all or *, or leave the field blank.
This is automatically populated with whatever was selected in the previous view before clicking the launch button.
* Machine Credential: Select the credential to use when accessing the remote hosts to run the command.
Choose the credential containing the username and SSH key or password that Ansible needs to log in to the remote hosts.
* Verbosity: Select a verbosity level for the standard output.
* Forks: If needed, select the number of parallel or simultaneous processes to use while executing the command.
* Show Changes: Select to enable the display of Ansible changes in the
standard output.
The default is OFF.
* Enable Privilege Escalation: If enabled, the playbook is run with administrator privileges.
This is the equivalent of passing the --become option to the ansible command.
* Extra Variables: Provide extra command line variables to be applied when running this inventory.
Enter variables using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
6. Click btn:[Next] to select the execution environment you want the ad hoc command to be run against.
7. Click btn:[Next] to select the credential you want to use.
8. Click btn:[Launch].
The results display in the Output tab of the module's job window.
