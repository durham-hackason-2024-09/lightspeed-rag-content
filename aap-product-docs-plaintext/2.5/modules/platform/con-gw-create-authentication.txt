# Creating an authentication method

The Create Authentication wizard guides you through the steps to create a new authentication method for your organization. The wizard is launched during the create authentication process.

There are 5 procedures involved in creating an authenticator, including:

1. Authentication type, where you will select the type of authenticator plugin you want to configure.
2. Authentication details, where you will configure the authentication details for the plugin you selected.
3. Mapping, where you will define mapping rule types and triggers to control access to the system.
4. Mapping order, where you can define the mapping precedence.

[NOTE]
----
Mapping order is only available if there are one or more authenticator maps defined.
----
5. Review, where you can review and confirm the authentication settings before creating the authentication method.
