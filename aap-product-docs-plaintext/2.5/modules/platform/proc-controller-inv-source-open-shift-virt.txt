# OpenShift Virtualization

This inventory source uses a cluster that is able to deploy Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Virtualization.
To configure a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform Virtualization, you need a virtual machine deployed in a specific namespace and an OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token credential.

1. From the navigational panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Inventories].
2. Select the inventory that you want to add a source to.
3. In the Sources tab, click btn:[Add source].
4. From the menu:Source[] menu, select OpenShift Virtualization.
* The Add new source window expands with the required Credential field.

Choose from an existing Kubernetes API Bearer Token credential.
For more information, see OpenShift or Kubernetes API Bearer Token credential type.
In this example, the cmv2.engineering.redhat.com credential is used.
5. You can optionally specify the Verbosity, Host Filter, Enabled Variable/Value, and Update options as described in the Adding a source steps.
6. Use the Source Variables field to override variables used by the kubernetes inventory plugin.
Enter variables by using either JSON or YAML syntax.
Use the radio button to toggle between the two.
For more information about these variables, see the kubevirt.core.kubevirt inventory source documentation.

In the following example, the connections variable is used to specify access to a particular namespace in a cluster:

```
---
connections:
- namespaces:
  - hao-test
```

7. Click btn:[Save] and then click btn:[Sync] to sync the inventory.
