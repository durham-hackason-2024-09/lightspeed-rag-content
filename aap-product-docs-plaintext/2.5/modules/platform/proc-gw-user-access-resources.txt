# Providing user access to a resource

You can grant users access to resources through the roles to which they are assigned.

1. From the navigation panel, select a resource to which you want to provide team access. For example, menu:Automation Execution[Templates].
2. Select the User access tab.
3. Click the checkbox beside the user to assign that user to your chosen type of resource and click btn:[Next].
4. Select the roles you want applied to the user for the chosen resource and click btn:[Next].
5. Review the settings and click btn:[Save]. A progress bar displays indicating whether the role assignments were successfully applied.
6. You can remove resource access for a user by selecting the - icon next to the user. This launches a confirmation dialog, asking you to confirm the removal.
