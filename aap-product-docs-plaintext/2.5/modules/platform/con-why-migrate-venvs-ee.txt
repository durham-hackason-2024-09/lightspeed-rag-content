# Migrating from legacy virtual environments (venvs) to automation execution environments

Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 moves you away from custom Python virtual environments (venvs) in favor of automation execution environments - containerized images that package the necessary components needed to run and scale your Ansible automation. These components include Ansible Core, Ansible Content Collections, Python dependencies, Red Hat Enterprise Linux UBI 8, and any additional package dependencies.

To migrate your venvs to execution environments, you must use the awx-manage command to list and export a list of venvs from your original instance, and then use ansible-builder to create execution environments.
