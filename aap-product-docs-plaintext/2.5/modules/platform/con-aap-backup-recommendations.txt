# Backup recommendations

Recovering from data loss requires that you plan for and create backup resources of your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployments on a regular basis. At a minimum, Red Hat recommends backing up deployments of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform under the following circumstances:

* Before upgrading your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployments.
* Before upgrading your OpenShift cluster.
* Once per week. This is particularly important if your environment is configured for automatic upgrades.
