# Splunk

Automation controller&#8217;s Splunk logging integration uses the Splunk HTTP Collector.
When configuring a SPLUNK logging aggregator, add the full URL to the HTTP Event Collector host, as in the following example:

https://<yourcontrollerfqdn>/api/v2/settings/logging

{
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_HOST": "https://<yoursplunk>:8088/services/collector/event",
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_PORT": null,
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_TYPE": "splunk",
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_USERNAME": "",
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_PASSWORD": "$encrypted$",
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_LOGGERS": [
        "awx",
        "activity_stream",
        "job_events",
        "system_tracking"
    ],
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_INDIVIDUAL_FACTS": false,
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_ENABLED": true,
    "LOG_AGGREGATOR_CONTROLLER_UUID": ""
}


[NOTE]
----
The Splunk HTTP Event Collector listens on port 8088 by default, so you must provide the full HEC event URL (with the port number) for LOG_AGGREGATOR_HOST for incoming requests to be processed successfully.

Typical values are shown in the following example:
