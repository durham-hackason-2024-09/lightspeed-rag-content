# Analytics Reports

Reports from collection are accessible through the automation controller UI if you have superuser-level permissions.
By including the analytics view on-prem where it is most convenient, you can access data that can affect your day-to-day work.
This data is aggregated from the automation provided on console.redhat.com.

Currently available is a view-only version of the Automation Calculator utility that shows a report that represents (possible) savings to the subscriber.
