# Recovering your Ansible Automation Platform deployment

In previous versions of the Ansible Automation Platform Operator, it was necessary to create a restore object for each component of the platform.
Now, you create a single AnsibleAutomationPlatformRestore resource, which  creates and manages the other restore objects:

* AutomationControllerRestore
* AutomationHubRestore
* EDARestore

* You must be authenticated with an OpenShift cluster.
* You have installed the Ansible Automation Platform Operator on the cluster.
* The AnsibleAutomationPlatformBackups deployment is available in your cluster.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Operators[Installed Operators].
3. Select your Ansible Automation Platform Operator deployment.
4. Go to your All Instances tab, and click btn:[Create New].
5. Select Ansible Automation Platform Restore from the list.
6. For Name enter the name for the recovery deployment.
7. For New Ansible Automation Platform Name enter the new name for your Ansible Automation Platform instance.
8. Backup Source defaults to CR.
9. For Backup name enter the name your chose when creating the backup.
10. Click btn:[Create].

Your backups starts restoring under the AnsibleAutomationPlatformRestores tab.


[NOTE]
----
The recovery is not complete until all the resources are successfully restored. Depending on the size of your database this this can take some time.
