* To find groups that contain the name "foo", use the following:

http://<controller server name>/api/v2/groups/?name__contains=foo
* To find an exact match, use the following:

http://<controller server name>/api/v2/groups/?name=foo
* If a resource is of an integer type, you must add \_\_int to the end to cast your string input value to an integer, such as the following:

http://<controller server name>/api/v2/arbitrary_resource/?x__int=5
* You can query related resources with the following:

http://<controller server name>/api/v2/users/?first_name__icontains=kim

This returns all users with names that include the string "Kim" in them.
* You can also filter against many fields at once:

http://<controller server name>/api/v2/groups/?name__icontains=test&has_active_failures=false

This finds all groups containing the name "test" that have no active failures.

For more information about what types of operators are available, see QuerySet API reference.
