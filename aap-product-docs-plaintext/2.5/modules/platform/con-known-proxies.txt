# Known proxies

When automation controller is configured with REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS = ['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'REMOTE_ADDR', 'REMOTE_HOST'], it assumes that the value of X-Forwarded-For has originated from the proxy/load balancer sitting in front of automation controller.
If automation controller is reachable without use of the proxy/load balancer, or if the proxy does not validate the header, the value of X-Forwarded-For can be falsified to fake the originating IP addresses.
Using HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR in the REMOTE_HOST_HEADERS setting poses a vulnerability.

To avoid this, you can configure a list of known proxies that are allowed.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[System].
2. Enter a list of proxy IP addresses from which the service should trust custom remote header values in the Proxy IP Allowed List field.

[NOTE]
----
Load balancers and hosts that are not on the known proxies list will result in a rejected request.
