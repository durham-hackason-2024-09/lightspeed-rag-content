# Getting started with credentials



The Credentials page displays a searchable list of all available credentials and can be sorted by Name.

If you delete items that are used by other work items, a message opens listing the items that are affected by the deletion and prompts you to confirm the deletion.
Some screens contain items that are invalid or previously deleted, and fail to run.
