# Fact caching

Automation controller can store and retrieve facts on a per-host basis through an Ansible Fact Cache plugin.
This behavior is configurable on a per-job template basis.
Fact caching is turned off by default but can be enabled to serve fact requests for all hosts in an inventory related to the job running.
This enables you to use job templates with --limit while still having access to the entire inventory of host facts.
You can specify a global timeout setting that the plugin enforces per-host, (in seconds) from the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[Job] and edit the Per-Host Ansible Fact Cache Timeout field.

After launching a job that uses fact cache (use_fact_cache=True), each host&#8217;s ansible_facts are all stored by the controller in the job&#8217;s inventory.

The Ansible Fact Cache plugin that includes automation controller is enabled on jobs with fact cache enabled (use_fact_cache=True).

When a job that has fact cache enabled (use_fact_cache=True) has run, automation controller restores all records for the hosts in the inventory.
Any records with update times newer than the currently stored facts per-host are updated in the database.

New and changed facts are logged through automation controller&#8217;s logging facility.
Specifically, to the system_tracking namespace or logger.
The logging payload includes the following fields:

* host_name
* inventory_id
* ansible_facts

ansible facts is a dictionary of all Ansible facts for host_name in the automation controller inventory, inventory_id.


[NOTE]
----
If a hostname includes a forward slash (/), fact cache does not work for that host.
If you have an inventory with 100 hosts and one host has a / in the name, the remaining 99 hosts still collect facts.
