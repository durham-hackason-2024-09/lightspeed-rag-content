# AWS Secrets Manager lookup

This plugin enables Amazon Web Services to be used as a credential input source to pull secrets from the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.
The AWS Secrets Manager provides similar service to Microsoft Azure Key Vault, and the AWS collection provides a lookup plugin for it.

When AWS Secrets Manager lookup is selected for Credential type, give the following metadata to configure your lookup:

* AWS Access Key (required): give the access key used for communicating with AWS key management system
* AWS Secret Key (required): give the secret as obtained by the AWS IAM console
