# Migrating to Ansible Automation Platform Operator

To migrate Ansible Automation Platform deployment to Ansible Automation Platform Operator, you must have the following:

* Secret key secret
* Postgresql configuration
* Role-based Access Control for the namespaces on the new OpenShift cluster
* The new OpenShift cluster must be able to connect to the previous PostgreSQL database


[NOTE]
----
You can store the secret key information in the inventory file before the initial Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform installation.
If you are unable to remember your secret key or have trouble locating your inventory file, contact Ansible support through the Red Hat Customer portal.
----

Before migrating your data from Ansible Automation Platform 2.x or earlier, you must back up your data for loss prevention. To backup your data, do the following:

1. Log in to your current deployment project.
2. Run setup.sh to create a backup of your current data or deployment:

For on-prem deployments of version 2.x or earlier:

```
$ ./setup.sh -b
```


For OpenShift deployments before version 2.0 (non-operator deployments):

```
./setup_openshift.sh -b
```
