# Set up a jump host to use with automation controller

Credentials supplied by automation controller do not flow to the jump host through ProxyCommand.
They are only used for the end-node when the tunneled connection is set up.

You can configure a fixed user/keyfile in the AWX user&#8217;s SSH configuration in the ProxyCommand definition that sets up the connection through the jump host.

For example:

Host tampa
Hostname 10.100.100.11
IdentityFile [privatekeyfile]

Host 10.100..
Proxycommand ssh -W [jumphostuser]@%h:%p tampa

You can also add a jump host to your automation controller instance through Inventory variables.

These variables can be set at either the inventory,
group, or host level.
To add this, navigate to your inventory and in the variables field of whichever level you choose, add the following
variables:

ansible_user: <user_name>
ansible_connection: ssh
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -q <user_name>@<jump_server_name>"'
