# Constructed Inventories

A constructed inventory has copies of hosts and groups in its input inventories, permitting jobs to target groups of servers across many inventories.
Groups and hostvars can be added to the inventory content, and hosts can be filtered to limit the size of the constructed inventory.

Constructed inventories use the ansible.builtin.constructed inventory model.

The key factors of a constructed inventory are:

* The normal Ansible hostvars namespace is available
* They provide groups

Constructed inventories take source_vars and limit as inputs and transform its input_inventories into a new inventory, complete with groups. Groups (existing or constructed) can then be referenced in the limit field to reduce the number of hosts produced.

You can construct groups based on these host properties:

* RHEL major or minor versions
* Windows hosts
* Cloud based instances tagged in a certain region
* other

The examples described in later sections are organized by the structure of the input inventories.
