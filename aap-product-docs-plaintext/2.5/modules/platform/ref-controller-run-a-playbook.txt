# Unable to run a playbook

If you are unable to run the helloworld.yml example playbook from the Managing projects section of the Getting started with automation controller guide due to playbook errors, try the following:

* Ensure that you are authenticating with the user currently running the commands.
If not, check how the username has been set up or pass the --user=username or -u username commands to specify a user.
* Is your YAML file correctly indented?
You might need to line up your whitespace correctly.
Indentation level is significant in YAML.
You can use yamlint to check your playbook.
