# Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have the minimum requirements for the RHEL virtual machine before proceeding.
For more information, see the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform system requirements.
* RHEL nodes must properly be subscribed to.
* RHEL subscription with baseos and appstream repositories must be enabled.
* Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions and the proper Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform channel must be enabled:

ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms for RHEL 8
ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms for RHEL 9
* The system that is going to run the ansible-playbook must have the ansible.receptor collection installed:
* If your system has access to the internet, use:

ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

Installing the receptor collection dependency from the requirements.yml file consistently retrieves the receptor version specified there.
Additionally, it retrieves any other collection dependencies that might be needed in the future.
* If your system does not have access to the internet, see Downloading a collection from Automation Hub to configure Automation Hub in Ansible Galaxy locally.
