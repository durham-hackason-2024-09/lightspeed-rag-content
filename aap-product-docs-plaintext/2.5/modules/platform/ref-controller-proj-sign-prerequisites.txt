# Prerequisites

* RHEL nodes must properly be subscribed to:
* RHEL subscription with baseos and appstream repositories must be enabled.
* Your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription and the proper channel must be enabled:

ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms for RHEL 8
ansible-automation-platform-2.4-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms for RHEL 9
* A valid GPG public or private keypair is required for signing content.
For more information, see How to create GPG keypairs.

For more information about GPG keys, see the GnuPG documentation.

Verify that you have a valid GPG keypair in your default GnuPG keyring, with the following command:

gpg --list-secret-keys

If this command produces no output, or one line of output that states, trustdb was created, then you do not have a secret key in your
default keyring.
In this case, refer to How to create GPG keypairs to learn how to create a new keypair before proceeding.
If it produces any other output, you have a valid secret key and are ready to use ansible-sign.
