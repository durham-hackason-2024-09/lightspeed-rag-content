# Define events with rulebooks

An Ansible rulebook is a collection of rulesets that references one or more sources, rules, and conditions.
Rulebooks are to Event-Driven Ansible what playbooks are to Ansible Automation Platform as a whole.
Like a playbook, a rulebook defines automation tasks for the platform, along with when they should be triggered.

# Rulebook actions

Rulebooks use an "if-this-then-that‚Äù logic that tells Event-Driven Ansible what actions to activate when a rule is triggered.
