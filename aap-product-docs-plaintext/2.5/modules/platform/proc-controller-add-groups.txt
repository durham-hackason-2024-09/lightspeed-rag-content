# Adding groups to inventories

Inventories are divided into groups, which can contain hosts and other groups.
Groups are only applicable to standard inventories and are not a configurable directly through a Smart Inventory.
You can associate an existing group through hosts that are used with standard inventories.

The following actions are available for standard inventories:

* Create a new Group
* Create a new Host
* Run a command on the selected Inventory
* Edit Inventory properties
* View activity streams for Groups and Hosts
* Obtain help building your Inventory


[NOTE]
----
Inventory sources are not associated with groups.
Spawned groups are top-level and can still have child groups.
All of these spawned groups can have hosts.
