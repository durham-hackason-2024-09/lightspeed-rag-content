# Configuring GitHub enterprise authentication

To set up social authentication for a GitHub enterprise, you must obtain a GitHub Enterprise URL, an API URL, OAuth2 key and secret for a web application.

To obtain the URLs, refer to the GitHub Enterprise administration documentation.

The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI. To register the application, you must supply it with your webpage URL, which is the Callback URL shown in the Authenticator details for your authenticator configuration. See Displaying authenticator details for instructions on accessing this information.

Each key and secret must belong to a unique application and cannot be shared or reused between different authentication backends. The OAuth2 key (Client ID) and secret (Client Secret) are used to supply the required fields in the UI.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Access Management[Authentication Methods].
2. Click btn:[Create authentication].
3. Select GitHub enterprise from the Authentication type list and click btn:[Next].
4. Enter a Name for this authentication configuration.
5. When the application is registered, GitHub displays the Client ID and Client Secret:
1. Copy and paste the GitHub Client ID into the GitHub OAuth2 Key field.
2. Copy and paste the GitHub Client Secret into the GitHub OAuth2 Secret field.
6. In the Base URL field, enter the hostname of the GitHub Enterprise instance, for example, https://github.example.com.
7. In the Github OAuth2 Enterprise API URL field, enter the API URL of the GitHub Enterprise instance, for example, https://github.example.com/api/v3.
8. Optional: Enter any Additional Authenticator Fields that this authenticator can take. These fields are not validated and are passed directly back to the authenticator.

[NOTE]
----
Values defined in this field override the dedicated fields provided in the UI.

9. To automatically create organizations, users, and teams upon successful login, select Create objects.
10. To enable this authentication method upon creation, select Enabled.
11. To remove a user for any groups they were previously added to when they authenticate from this source, select Remove users.
12. Click btn:[Next].

To control which users are allowed into the Ansible Automation Platform server, and placed into Ansible Automation Platform organizations or teams based on their attributes (like username and email address) or to what groups they belong, continue to Mapping.

To verify that the authentication is configured correctly, log out of Ansible Automation Platform and check that the login screen displays the logo of your authentication chosen method to enable logging in with those credentials.
