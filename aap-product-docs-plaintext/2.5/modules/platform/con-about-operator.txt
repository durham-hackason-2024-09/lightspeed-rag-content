# About Ansible Automation Platform Operator

The Ansible Automation Platform Operator provides cloud-native, push-button deployment of new Ansible Automation Platform instances in your OpenShift environment.
The Ansible Automation Platform Operator includes resource types to deploy and manage instances of automation controller and private automation hub.
It also includes automation controller job resources for defining and launching jobs inside your automation controller deployments.

Deploying Ansible Automation Platform instances with a Kubernetes native operator offers several advantages over launching instances from a playbook deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, including upgrades and full lifecycle support for your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform deployments.

You can install the Ansible Automation Platform Operator from the Red Hat Operators catalog in OperatorHub.
