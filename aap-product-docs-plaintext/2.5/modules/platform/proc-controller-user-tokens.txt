# Creating tokens for a user

The Tokens tab is only present for the user you created for yourself.

Before you add a token for your user, you might want to Create an application if you want to
associate your token with it.

You can also create a Personal Access Token (PAT) without associating it with any application.

1. Select your user from the Users list view to configure your OAuth 2 tokens.
2. Select the Tokens tab from your user's profile.
3. Click btn:[Add] to open the Create Token window.
4. Enter the following information:
* Application: Enter the name of the application with which you want to associate your token.

Alternatively, you can search for the application name clicking the  icon.
This opens a separate window that enables you to choose from the available options.
Use the Search bar to filter by name if the list is extensive.

Leave this field blank if you want to create a PAT that is not linked to any application.
* Optional: Description: Provide a short description for your token.
* Scope: Specify the level of access you want this token to have.
5. Click btn:[Save] or btn:[Cancel] to abandon your changes.
6. After the token is saved, the newly created token for the user is displayed.
