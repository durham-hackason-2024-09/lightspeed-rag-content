# Amazon Web Services credential type

Select this credential to enable synchronization of cloud inventory with Amazon Web Services.
Automation controller uses the following environment variables for AWS credentials:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN
These are fields prompted in the user interface.
Amazon Web Services credentials consist of the AWS Access Key and Secret Key.
Automation controller provides support for EC2 STS tokens, also known as Identity and Access Management (IAM) STS credentials.
Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS
IAM users.

[NOTE]
----
If the value of your tags in EC2 contain Booleans (yes/no/true/false), you must quote them.
----

[WARNING]
----
To use implicit IAM role credentials, do not attach AWS cloud credentials in automation controller when relying on IAM roles to access the AWS API.
Attaching your AWS cloud credential to your job template forces the use of your AWS credentials, not your IAM role credentials.
----
For more information about the IAM/EC2 STS Token, see Temporary security credentials in IAM.
