# Resetting TOWER_URL_BASE

Automation controller determines how the base URL (TOWER_URL_BASE) is defined by looking at an incoming request and setting the server address based on that incoming request.

Automation controller takes settings values from the database first.
If no settings values are found, it uses the values from the settings files.
If you post a license by navigating to the automation controller host&#8217;s IP address, the posted license is written to the settings entry in the database.

Use the following procedure to reset TOWER_URL_BASE if the wrong address has been picked up:

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Settings[System].
2. Click btn:[Edit].
3. Enter the address in the Base URL of the service field for the DNS entry you want to appear in notifications.
