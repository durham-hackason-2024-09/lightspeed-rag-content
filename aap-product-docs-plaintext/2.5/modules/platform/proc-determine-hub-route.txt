# Determining the automation hub Route

Use the following procedure to determine the hub route.

1. Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
2. Navigate to menu:Networking[Routes].
3. Select the project you used for the install.
4. Copy the location of the private-ah-web-svc service.
The name of the service is different if you used a different name when creating the automation hub instance.
This is used later to update the Red Hat Single Sign-On client.
