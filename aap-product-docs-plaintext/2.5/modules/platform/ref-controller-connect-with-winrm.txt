# Connect to Windows with winrm

By default, automation controller attempts to ssh to hosts.

You must add the winrm connection information to the group variables to which the Windows hosts belong.

To get started, edit the Windows group in which the hosts reside and place the variables in the source or edit screen for the group.

To add winrm connection info:

* Edit the properties for the selected group by clicking on the Edit  icon of the group name that contains the Windows servers.
In the "variables" section, add your connection information as follows: ansible_connection: winrm

When complete, save your edits.
If Ansible was previously attempting an SSH connection and failed, you should re-run the job template.
