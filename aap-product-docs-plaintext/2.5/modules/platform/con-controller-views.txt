# Views

The automation controller UI provides several options for viewing information.
* Dashboard view
* Jobs view
* Schedules view
* Activity Stream
* Workflow Approvals
* Host Metrics

# Jobs view

* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Jobs].
This view displays the jobs that have run, including projects, templates, management jobs, SCM updates, and playbook runs.



# Schedules view

From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Schedules]. This view shows all the scheduled jobs that are configured.



# Activity Stream

* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Administration > Activity Stream] to display Activity Streams.
Most screens have an Activity Stream  icon.



An Activity Stream shows all changes for a particular object.

For each change, the Activity Stream shows the time of the event, the user that initiated the event, and the action.
The information displayed varies depending on the type of event.

Click the btn:[Examine]  icon to display the event log for the change.



You can filter the Activity Stream by the initiating user, by system (if it was system initiated), or by any related object, such as a credential, job template, or schedule.

The Activity Stream on the main Dashboard shows the Activity Stream for the entire instance.
Most pages permit viewing an activity stream filtered for that specific object.

# Workflow Approvals

* From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Administration > Workflow Approvals] to see your workflow approval queue.
The list contains actions that require you to approve or deny before a job can proceed.

# Host Metrics

* From the navigation panel, select menu:Host Metrics[] to see the activity associated with hosts, which includes counts on those that have been automated, used in inventories, and deleted.
