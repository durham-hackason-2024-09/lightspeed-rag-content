# Prerequisites

The automation mesh is dependent on hop and execution nodes running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
Your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform subscription grants you ten Red Hat Enterprise Linux licenses that can be used for running components of Ansible Automation Platform.

For more information about Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscriptions, see Registering the system and managing subscriptions in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

The following steps prepare the RHEL instances for deployment of the automation mesh.

1. You require a Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.
Each node in the mesh requires a static IP address, or a resolvable DNS hostname that Ansible Automation Platform can access.
2. Ensure that you have the minimum requirements for the RHEL virtual machine before proceeding.
For more information, see the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform system requirements.
3. Deploy the RHEL instances within the remote networks where communication is required.
For information about creating virtual machines, see Creating Virtual Machines in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation. Remember to scale the capacity of your virtual machines sufficiently so that your proposed tasks can run on them.
* RHEL ISOs can be obtained from access.redhat.com.
* RHEL cloud images can be built using Image Builder from console.redhat.com.
