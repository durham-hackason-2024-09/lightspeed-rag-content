# High availability automation hub

Use the following examples to populate the inventory file to install a highly available automation hub. This inventory file includes a highly available automation hub with a clustered setup.

You can configure your HA deployment further to enable a high availability deployment of automation hub on SELinux.

* Specify the IP address for your database host, using the automation_pg_host and automation_pg_port inventory variables. For example:


```
automationhub_pg_host='192.0.2.10'
automationhub_pg_port=5432
```


* Also specify the IP address for your database host in the [database] section, using the value in the automationhub_pg_host inventory variable:


```
[database]
192.0.2.10
```


* If installing a clustered setup, replace localhost ansible_connection=local in the [automationhub] section with the hostname or IP of all instances. For example:


```
[automationhub]
automationhub1.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user ansible_host=192.0.2.18
automationhub2.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user ansible_host=192.0.2.20
automationhub3.testing.ansible.com ansible_user=cloud-user ansible_host=192.0.2.22
```


Check that the following directives are present in /etc/pulp/settings.py in each of the private automation hub servers:


```
USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT = True
USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST = True
```



[NOTE]
----
If automationhub_main_url is not specified, the first node in the [automationhub] group will be used as default.
