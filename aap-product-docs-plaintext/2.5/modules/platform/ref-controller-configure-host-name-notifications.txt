# Configuring the controllerhost hostname for notifications

From the System settings page, you can replace https://controller.example.com in the Base URL of the Service field with your preferred hostname to change the notification hostname.

Refreshing your automation controller license also changes the notification hostname.
New installations of automation controller need not set the hostname for notifications.
