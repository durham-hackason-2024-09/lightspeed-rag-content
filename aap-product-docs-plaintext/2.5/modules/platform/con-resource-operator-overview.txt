# Resource Operator overview

These YAML files are then used by {ControllerName} to create these resources.
You can create the YAML through the *Form view* that prompts you for keys and values for your YAML code.
Alternatively, to work with YAML directly, you can select *YAML view*.

There are currently two custom resources provided by the Resource Operator:

* AnsibleJob: launches a job in the automation controller instance specified in the Kubernetes secret (automation controller host URL, token).
* JobTemplate: creates a job template in the automation controller instance specified.
