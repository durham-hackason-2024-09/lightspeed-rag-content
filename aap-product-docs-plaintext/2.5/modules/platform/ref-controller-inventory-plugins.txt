# Inventory Plugins

Inventory updates use dynamically-generated YAML files which are parsed by their inventory plugin.
In automation controller v4.4, you can provide the inventory plugin configuration directly to automation controller using the inventory source source_vars for the following inventory sources:

* Amazon Web Services EC2
* Google Compute Engine
* Microsoft Azure Resource Manager
* VMware vCenter
* Red Hat Satellite 6
* Red Hat Insights
* OpenStack
* Red Hat Virtualization
* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
* Terraform State
* OpenShift Virtualization

Newly created configurations for inventory sources contain the default plugin configuration values.
If you want your newly created inventory sources to match the output of a legacy source, you must apply a specific set of configuration values for that source.
To ensure backward compatibility, automation controller uses "templates" for each of these sources to force the output of inventory plugins into the legacy
format.

For more information about sources and their templates, see Supported inventory plugin templates.

source_vars that contain plugin: foo.bar.baz as a top-level key are replaced with the fully-qualified inventory plugin name at runtime based on the InventorySource source.
For example, if you select ec2 for the InventorySource then, at run-time, plugin is  set to amazon.aws.aws_ec2.
