# Add a subscription manually

If you are unable to apply or update the subscription information by using the automation controller user interface, you can upload the subscriptions manifest manually in an Ansible Playbook.

Use the license module in the ansible.controller collection:

- name: Set the license using a file
  license:
  manifest: "/tmp/my_manifest.zip"

For more information, see the Automation controller license module.
