# modifying-the-run-schedule

You can configure metrics-utility to run at specified times and intervals. Run frequency is expressed in cronjobs; see How to schedule jobs using the Linux ‘Cron’ utility for more information.

# On RHEL

## Procedure

1. From the command line, run:

```
crontab -e
```

2. After the code editor has opened, update the gather and build parameters using cron syntax as shown below:

```
*/2 * * * *     metrics-utility gather_automation_controller_billing_data --ship --until=10m
*/5 * * * *     metrics-utili
ty build_report
```

3. Save and close the file.

# On Openshift Container Platform from the AAP operator

## Procedure

1. From the navigation panel, select Workloads > Deployments.
2. On the next screen, click automation-controller-operator-controller-manager.
3. Beneath the heading Deployment Details, click the down arrow button to change the number of pods to zero. This will pause the deployment so you can update the running schedule.
4. From the navigation panel, click Installed Operators. From the list of installed operators, select Ansible Automation Platform.
5. On the next screen, select the Automation Controller tab.
6. From the list that appears, click your controller instance.
7. On the next screen, select the YAML tab.
8. In the YAML file, find the following parameters and enter a variable representing how often metrics-utility should gather data and how often it should produce a report:

```
metrics_utility_cronjob_gather_schedule:
metrics_utility_cronjob_report_schedule:
```

9. Click Save.
10. From the navigation menu, select Deployments and click automation-controller-operator-controller-manager.
11. Increase the number of pods to 1.
12. To verify that you have changed the utility-metrics running schedule successfully, return to the YAML file and ensure that the parameters described above reflect the correct variables. OR From the navigation menu, select Workloads > Cronjobs and ensure that your cronjobs show the updated schedule.
