# Container capacity limits

Capacity limits and quotas for containers are defined by objects in the Kubernetes API:

* To set limits on all pods within a given namespace, use the LimitRange object.
For more information see the Quotas and Limit Ranges section of the OpenShift documentation.
* To set limits directly on the pod definition launched by automation controller, see Customizing the pod specification and the Compute Resources section of the OpenShift documentation.


[NOTE]
----
Container groups do not use the capacity algorithm that normal nodes use.
You need to set the number of forks at the job template level.
If you configure forks in automation controller, that setting is passed along to the container.
