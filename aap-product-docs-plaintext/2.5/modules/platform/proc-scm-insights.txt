# SCM Type - Configuring playbooks to use Red Hat Insights

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Projects].
2. Click the project name you want to use.
3. In the project Details tab, click btn:[Edit project].
4. Select Red Hat Insights from the Source Control Type menu.
5. In the Credential field, select the appropriate credential for use with Insights, as Red Hat Insights requires a credential for authentication.
6. Optional: In the Options field, select the launch behavior, if applicable:
* Clean - Removes any local modifications before performing an update.
* Delete - Deletes the local repository in its entirety before performing an update.
Depending on the size of the repository this can significantly increase the amount of time required to complete an
update.
* Update Revision on Launch - Updates the revision of the project to the current revision in the remote source control, and caches the
roles directory from Ansible Galaxy support or Collections support.
Automation controller ensures that the local revision matches, and that the roles and collections are up-to-date.
If jobs are spawned faster than the project can synchronize, selecting this enables you to configure a Cache Timeout to
cache previous project synchronizations for a certain number of seconds, to avoid job overflow.
7. Click btn:[Save project].
