# Secret handling

Automation controller manages three sets of secrets:
* User passwords for local automation controller users.
* Secrets for automation controller operational use, such as database password or message bus password.
* Secrets for automation use, such as SSH keys, cloud credentials, or external password vault credentials.

[NOTE]
----
You must have 'local' user access for the following users:
* postgres
* awx
* redis
* receptor
* nginx
----

# User passwords for local users

Automation controller hashes local automation controller user passwords with the PBKDF2 algorithm using a SHA256 hash.
Users who authenticate by external account mechanisms, such as LDAP, SAML, and OAuth, do not have any password or secret stored.
