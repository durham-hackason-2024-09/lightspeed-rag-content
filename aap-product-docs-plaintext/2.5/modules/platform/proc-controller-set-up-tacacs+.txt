# Configuring TACACS+ authentication

Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) is a protocol that handles remote authentication and related services for networked access control through a centralized server. TACACS+ provides authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) services, in which you can configure Ansible Automation Platform to use as a source for authentication.
