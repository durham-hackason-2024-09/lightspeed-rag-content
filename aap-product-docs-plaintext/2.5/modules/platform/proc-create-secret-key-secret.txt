# Creating a secret key secret

To migrate your data to Ansible Automation Platform Operator on OpenShift Container Platform, you must create a secret key that matches the secret key defined in the inventory file during your initial installation. Otherwise, the migrated data will remain encrypted and unusable after migration.

1. Locate the old secret key in the inventory file you used to deploy Ansible Automation Platform in your previous installation.
2. Create a yaml file for your secret key:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <resourcename>-secret-key
  namespace: <target-namespace>
stringData:
  secret_key: <old-secret-key>
type: Opaque
```

3. Apply the secret key yaml to the cluster:

```
oc apply -f <secret-key.yml>
```
