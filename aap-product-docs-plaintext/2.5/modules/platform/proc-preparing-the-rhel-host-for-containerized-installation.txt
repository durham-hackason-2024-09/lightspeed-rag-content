# Preparing the RHEL host for containerized installation

Containerized Ansible Automation Platform runs the component services as Podman based containers on top of a RHEL host. The installer takes care of this once the underlying host has been prepared.

Use the following instructions to prepare the RHEL host:

1. Log in to the RHEL host as your non-root user.
2. Register your RHEL host with subscription-manager:

```
sudo subscription-manager register
```

3. Run sudo dnf repolist to validate that only the BaseOS and AppStream repositories are setup and enabled on the host:

```
$ sudo dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                    repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                           Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
```

4. Ensure that only these repositories are available to the RHEL host. For more information about managing custom repositories, see:
Chapter 10. Managing custom software repositories.
5. Ensure that the host has DNS configured and can resolve host names and IP addresses by using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is essential to ensure services can talk to one another.
6. Optional: To have the installer automatically pick up and apply your Ansible Automation Platform subscription manifest license, follow the steps in Chapter 2. Obtaining a manifest file.
