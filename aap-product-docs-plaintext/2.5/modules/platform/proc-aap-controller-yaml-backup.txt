# Using YAML to back up the Automation controller deployment

See the following procedure for how to back up a deployment of the automation controller using YAML.

* You must be authenticated with an OpenShift cluster.
* You have installed Ansible Automation Platform Operator on the cluster.
* You have deployed automation controller using the Ansible Automation Platform Operator.

1. Create a file named "backup-awx.yml" with the following contents:

```
---
apiVersion: automationcontroller.ansible.com/v1beta1
kind: AWXBackup
metadata:
  name: awxbackup-2024-07-15
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  deployment_name: controller
```


[NOTE]
----
The "deployment_name" above is the name of the automation controller deployment you intend to backup from.
The namespace above is the one containing the automation controller deployment you intend to back up.
----
2. Use the oc apply command to create the backup object in your cluster:

$ oc apply -f backup-awx.yml
