# Obtaining a subscriptions manifest

To upload a subscriptions manifest, first set up your subscription allocations:
1. Navigate to https://access.redhat.com/management/subscription_allocations.
The Subscriptions Allocations page has no subscriptions until you create one.
2. Click btn:[Create New subscription allocation].

[NOTE]
----
If Create New subscription allocation does not display, or is disabled, you do not have the proper permissions to create subscription allocations.
To create a subscription allocation, you must either be an Administrator on the Red Hat Customer Portal, or have the Manage Your Subscriptions role.
Contact an access.redhat.com administrator, or organization administrator who can grant you permission to manage subscriptions.
----
3. Enter a Name for your subscription and select 6.15 from the Type drop-down menu.
4. Click btn:[Create].

When your subscriptions manifest is successfully created, the number indicated next to Entitlements indicates the number of entitlements associated with your subscription.

# Setting up a subscriptions manifest

To obtain a subscriptions manifest, you must add an entitlement to your subscriptions through the Subscriptions tab.

1. Click the Subscriptions tab.
2. If there are no subscriptions to display, click btn:[Add Subscriptions].
3. On the following screen you can select and add entitlements to put in the manifest file.
![Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions]

You can select multiple Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions in your subscription allocation.
Valid Ansible Automation Platform subscriptions commonly go by the name "Red Hat Ansible Automationâ€¦".
4. Specify the number of entitlements or managed nodes to put in the manifest file.
This enables you to split up a subscription, for example: 400 nodes on a development cluster and 600 nodes for the production cluster, out of a 1000 node subscription.

[NOTE]
----
You can apply multiple subscriptions to a single installation by adding multiple subscriptions of the same type to a manifest file and uploading them.
Similarly, you can apply a subset of a subscription by only allocating a part of the subscription when creating the manifest.
----
5. Click btn:[Submit].

The allocations you specified, when successfully added, are displayed in the Subscriptions tab.
6. Click the Details tab to access the subscription manifest file.
7. Click btn:[Export Manifest] to export the manifest file for this subscription.
A folder pre-pended with manifest_ is downloaded to your local drive.
Multiple subscriptions with the same SKU are aggregated.
8. When you have a subscription manifest, go to the Subscription screen.
9. Click btn:[Browse] to upload the entire manifest file.
10. Navigate to the location where the file is saved.
Do not open it or upload individual parts of it.
