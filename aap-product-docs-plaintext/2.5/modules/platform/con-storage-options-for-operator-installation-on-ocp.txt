# Storage options for Ansible Automation Platform Operator installation on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

Automation hub requires ReadWriteMany file-based storage, Azure Blob storage, or Amazon S3-compliant storage for operation so that multiple pods can access shared content, such as collections.

The process for configuring object storage on the AutomationHub CR is similar for Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage.

If you are using file-based storage and your installation scenario includes automation hub, ensure that the storage option for Ansible Automation Platform Operator is set to ReadWriteMany.
ReadWriteMany is the default storage option.

In addition, OpenShift Data Foundation provides a ReadWriteMany or S3-compliant implementation. Also, you can set up NFS storage configuration to support ReadWriteMany. This, however, introduces the NFS server as a potential, single point of failure.
