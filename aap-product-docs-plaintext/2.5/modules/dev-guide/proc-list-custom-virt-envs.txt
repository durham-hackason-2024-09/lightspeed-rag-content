# Listing custom virtual environments

You can list the virtual environments on your automation controller instance using the awx-manage command.

1. SSH into your automation controller instance and run:

```
$ awx-manage list_custom_venvs
```


A list of discovered virtual environments will appear.


```
# Discovered virtual environments:
/var/lib/awx/venv/testing
/var/lib/venv/new_env

To export the contents of a virtual environment, re-run while supplying the path as an argument:
awx-manage export_custom_venv /path/to/venv
```
