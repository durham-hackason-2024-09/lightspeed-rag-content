# Creating automation execution environments

An automation execution environments definition file will specify:: 
* An Ansible version
* A Python version (defaults to system Python)
* A set of required Python libraries
* Zero or more Content Collections (optional)
* Python dependencies for those specific Collections

The concept of specifying a set of Collections for an environment is to resolve and install their dependencies. The Collections themselves are not required to be installed on the machine that you are generating the automation execution environments on.

An automation execution environments is built from this definition, and results in a container image. Please read the Ansible Builder documentation to learn the steps involved in creating these images.
