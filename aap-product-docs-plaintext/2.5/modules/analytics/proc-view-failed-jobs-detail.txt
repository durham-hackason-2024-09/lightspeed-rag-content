# Example: Reviewing failed jobs

You can view more detail about failed jobs across your organization by drilling down on the graph on the Cluster view and using the Job Explorer to refine results. Clicking on a specific portion in a graph will open that information in the Job Explorer, preserving contextual information created when using filters on the Clusters view.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Analytics[Clusters].
2. Using the filter lists in the toolbar, you can apply filters for clusters and time range of your choosing.
3. Click on a segment on the graph.

You are redirected to the Job Explorer view, and presented with a list of successful and failed jobs corresponding to that day on the bar graph.

To view only failed jobs:

1. Select Status from the Filter by list.
2. Select the Failed filter.

The view is updated to show only failed jobs run on that day.

Add additional context to the view by applying additional filters and selecting attributes to sort results. Link out and review more information for failed jobs on the automation controller job details page.
