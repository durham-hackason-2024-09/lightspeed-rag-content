# Drilling down into cluster  data

You can drill down into cluster data to review more detailed information about successful or failed jobs. The detailed view, presented on the Job Explorer page, provides information on the cluster, organization, template, and job type. Filters you select on the Clusters view carry over to the Job Explorer page.
Details on those job templates will appear in the Job Explorer view, modified by any filters you select in the Clusters view.
For example, you can drill down to review details for failed jobs in a cluster. See below to learn more.

# Example: Reviewing failed jobs

You can view more detail about failed jobs across your organization by drilling down on the graph on the Cluster view and using the Job Explorer to refine results. Clicking on a specific portion in a graph will open that information in the Job Explorer, preserving contextual information created when using filters on the Clusters view.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Analytics[Clusters].
2. Using the filter lists in the toolbar, you can apply filters for clusters and time range of your choosing.
3. Click on a segment on the graph.

You are redirected to the Job Explorer view, and presented with a list of successful and failed jobs corresponding to that day on the bar graph.

To view only failed jobs:

1. Select Status from the Filter by list.
2. Select the Failed filter.

The view is updated to show only failed jobs run on that day.

Add additional context to the view by applying additional filters and selecting attributes to sort results. Link out and review more information for failed jobs on the automation controller job details page.
