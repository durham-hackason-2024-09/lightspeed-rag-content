# File systems mounted with "noexec"

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG requires that a number of file systems are mounted with the noexec option to prevent execution of binaries located in these file systems. The Ansible Automation Platform installer runs a preflight check that will fail if any of the following file systems are mounted with the noexec option:

* /tmp
* /var
* /var/tmp

To install Ansible Automation Platform, you must re-mount these file systems with the noexec option removed. Once installation is complete, proceed with the following steps:

1. Reapply the noexec option to the /tmp and /var/tmp file systems.
2. Change the automation controller job execution path from /tmp to an alternate directory that does not have the noexec option enabled.
3. To make this change, log in to the automation controller UI as an administrator, navigate to Settings and select Jobs settings.
4. Change the "Job execution path" setting to the alternate directory.

During normal operations, the file system which contains the /var/lib/awx subdirectory (typically /var) must not be mounted with the noexec option, or the automation controller cannot run automation jobs in execution environments.

In environments where STIG controls are routinely audited, discuss waiving the STIG controls related to file system noexec with your security auditor.
