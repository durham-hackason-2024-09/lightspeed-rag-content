# Private automation hub authentication

Private automation hub currently supports the following external authentication mechanisms:

* Ansible Automation Platform central authentication (based on RHSSO)
* LDAP

For production use, LDAP is the preferred external authentication mechanism for private automation hub. Ansible Automation Platform central authentication is an option that can be deployed with the Ansible Automation Platform installer, but it only deploys one central authentication server instance, making it a potential single point of failure. Standalone mode for Ansible Automation Platform central authentication is not recommended in a production environment. However, if you already have the separate Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO) product deployed in your production environment, it can be used as an external authentication source for private automation hub.

The Ansible Automation Platform Installer configures LDAP authentication for private automation hub during installation. For more information, see LDAP configuration on a private automation hub.

The following installer inventory file variables must be filled out prior to installation:



In order to ensure that LDAP traffic is encrypted between the private automation hub and the LDAP server, the LDAP server must support LDAP over TLS or LDAP over SSL (LDAPS).
