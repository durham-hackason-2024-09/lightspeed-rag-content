# Security-relevant variables in the installation inventory

The installation inventory file defines the architecture of the Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure, and provides a number of variables that can be used to modify the initial configuration of the infrastructure components. For more information on the installer inventory, see the Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide.

The following table lists a number of security-relevant variables and their recommended values for creating the installation inventory.



In scenarios such as the reference architecture where a load balancer is used with multiple controllers or hubs, SSL client connections can be terminated at the load balancer or passed through to the individual Ansible Automation Platform servers. If SSL is being terminated at the load balancer, this guide recommends that the traffic gets re-encrypted from the load balancer to the individual Ansible Automation Platform servers, to ensure that end-to-end encryption is in use. In this scenario, the *_disable_https variables listed in Table 2.3 would remain the default value of "false".


[NOTE]
----
This guide recommends using an external database in production environments, but for development and testing scenarios the database could be co-located on the automation controller. Due to current PostgreSQL 13 limitations, setting pg_sslmode = verify-full when the database is co-located on the automation controller results in an error validating the host name during TLS negotiation. Until this issue is resolved, an external database must be used to ensure mutual TLS authentication between the automation controller and the database.
