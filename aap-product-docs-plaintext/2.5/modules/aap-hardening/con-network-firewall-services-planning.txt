# Network, firewall, and network services planning for Ansible Automation Platform

Ansible Automation Platform requires access to a network to integrate to external auxiliary services and to manage target environments and resources such as hosts, other network devices, applications, cloud services. The network ports and protocols section of the Ansible Automation Platform planning guide describes how Ansible Automation Platform components interact on the network as well as which ports and protocols are used, as shown in the following diagram:

When planning firewall or cloud network security group configurations related to Ansible Automation Platform, see the Network ports and protocols section of the Ansible Automation Platform Planning Guide to understand what network ports need to be opened on a firewall or security group.

For more information on using a load balancer, and for outgoing traffic requirements for services compatible with Ansible Automation Platform. Consult the Red Hat Knowledgebase article What ports need to be opened in the firewall for Ansible Automation Platform 2 Services?. For internet-connected systems, this article also defines the outgoing traffic requirements for services that Ansible Automation Platform can be configured to use, such as Ansible automation hub, Red Hat Insights for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, Ansible Galaxy, the registry.redhat.io container image registry, and so on.

Restrict access to the ports used by the Ansible Automation Platform components to protected networks and clients. The following restrictions are highly recommended:

* Restrict the PostgreSQL database port (5432) on the database servers so that only the other Ansible Automation Platform component servers (automation controller, automation hub, Event-Driven Ansible controller) are permitted access.
* Restrict SSH access to the Ansible Automation Platform servers from the installation host and other trusted systems used for maintenance access to the Ansible Automation Platform servers.
* Restrict HTTPS access to the automation controller, automation hub, and Event-Driven Ansible controller from trusted networks and clients.
