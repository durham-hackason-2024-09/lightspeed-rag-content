# Automation controller authentication

Automation controller currently supports the following external authentication mechanisms:

* Azure Activity Directory
* GitHub single sign-on
* Google OAuth2 single sign-in
* LDAP
* RADIUS
* SAML
* TACACS+
* Generic OIDC

Choose an authentication mechanism that adheres to your organization&#8217;s authentication policies, and refer to the Controller Configuration - Authentication documentation to understand the prerequisites for the relevant authentication mechanism. The authentication mechanism used must ensure that the authentication-related traffic between Ansible Automation Platform and the authentication back-end is encrypted when the traffic occurs on a public or non-secure network (for example, LDAPS or LDAP over TLS, HTTPS for OAuth2 and SAML providers, etc.).

In automation controller, any “system administrator” account can edit, change, and update any inventory or automation definition. Restrict these account privileges to the minimum set of users possible for low-level automation controller configuration and disaster recovery.
