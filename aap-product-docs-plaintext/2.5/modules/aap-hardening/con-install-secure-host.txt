# Install from a dedicated installation host

The Ansible Automation Platform installer can be run from one of the infrastructure servers, such as an automation controller, or from an external system that has SSH access to the Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure servers. The Ansible Automation Platform installer is also used not just for installation, but for subsequent day-two operations, such as backup and restore, as well as upgrades. This guide recommends performing installation and day-two operations from a dedicated external server, hereafter referred to as the installation host. Doing so eliminates the need to log in to one of the infrastructure servers to run these functions. The installation host must only be used for management of Ansible Automation Platform and must not run any other services or software.

The installation host must be a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server that has been installed and configured in accordance with Security hardening for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and any security profile requirements relevant to your organization (CIS, STIG, and so on). Obtain the Ansible Automation Platform installer as described in the Automation Platform Planning Guide, and create the installer inventory file as describe in the Automation Platform Installation Guide. This inventory file is used for upgrades, adding infrastructure components, and day-two operations by the installer, so preserve the file after installation for future operational use.

Access to the installation host must be restricted only to those personnel who are responsible for managing the Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure. Over time, it will contain sensitive information, such as the installer inventory (which contains the initial login credentials for Ansible Automation Platform), copies of user-provided PKI keys and certificates, backup files, and so on. The installation host must also be used for logging in to the Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure servers through SSH when necessary for infrastructure management and maintenance.
