# User namespaces

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG requires that the kernel setting user.max_user_namespaces is set to "0", but only if Linux containers are not in use. Because Ansible Automation Platform uses containers as part of its execution environment capability, this STIG control does not apply to the automation controller.

To check the user.max_user_namespaces kernel setting, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to your automation controller at the command line.
2. Run the command sudo sysctl user.max_user_namespaces.
3. If the output indicates that the value is zero, look at the contents of the file /etc/sysctl.conf and all files under /etc/sysctl.d/, edit the file containing the user.max_user_namespaces setting, and set the value to "65535".
4. To apply this new value, run the command sudo sysctl -p <file>, where <file> is the file just modified.
5. Re-run the command sudo sysctl user.max_user_namespaces and verify that the value is now set to "65535".
