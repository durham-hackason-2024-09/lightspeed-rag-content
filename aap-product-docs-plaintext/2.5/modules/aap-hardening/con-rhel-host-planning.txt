# Red Hat Enterprise Linux host planning

The security of Ansible Automation Platform relies in part on the configuration of the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers. For this reason, the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts for each Ansible Automation Platform component must be installed and configured in accordance with the Security hardening for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 or Security hardening for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (depending on which operating system will be used), as well as any security profile requirements (CIS, STIG, HIPAA, and so on) used by your organization.

Note that applying certain security controls from the STIG or other security profiles may conflict with Ansible Automation Platform support requirements. Some examples are listed in the Automation controller STIG considerations section, although this is not an exhaustive list. To maintain a supported configuration, be sure to discuss any such conflicts with your security auditors so the Ansible Automation Platform requirements are understood and approved.
