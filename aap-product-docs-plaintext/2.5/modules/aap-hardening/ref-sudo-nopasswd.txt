# Sudo and NOPASSWD

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG requires that all users with sudo privileges must provide a password (that is, the "NOPASSWD" directive must not be used in a sudoers file). The Ansible Automation Platform installer runs many tasks as a privileged user, and by default expects to be able to elevate privileges without a password. To provide a password to the installer for elevating privileges, append the following options when launching the installer script: ./setup.sh <setup options>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;â€“-ask-become-pass.

This also applies when running the installer script for day-two operations such as backup and restore.
