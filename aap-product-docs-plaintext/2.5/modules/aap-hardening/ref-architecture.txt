# Ansible Automation Platform reference architecture

For large-scale production environments with availability requirements, this guide recommends deploying the components described in section 2.1 of this guide using the instructions in the reference architecture documentation for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While some variation may make sense for your specific technical requirements, following the reference architecture results in a supported production-ready environment.

Event-Driven Ansible is a new feature of Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 that was not available when the reference architecture detailed in Figure 1: Reference architecture overview was originally written. Currently, the supported configuration is a single automation controller, single automation hub, and single Event-Driven Ansible controller node with external (installer managed) database. For an organization interested in Event-Driven Ansible, the recommendation is to install according to the configuration documented in the Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide. This document provides additional clarifications when Event-Driven Ansible specific hardening configuration is required.

For smaller production deployments where the full reference architecture may not be needed, this guide recommends deploying Ansible Automation Platform with a dedicated PostgreSQL database server whether managed by the installer or provided externally.
