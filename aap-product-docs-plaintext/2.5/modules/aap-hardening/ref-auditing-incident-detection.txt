# Auditing and incident detection

Ansible Automation Platform should be used to fulfill security policy requirements by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for common use cases, such as:

* Requiring HTTPS for web servers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Requiring TLS encryption for internal communication between web servers and database servers on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Generating reports showing that the policy is properly deployed.
* Monitoring for drift that violates the policy.
* Automating correction of any policy violation.

This can be done through 5 steps of the cybersecurity framework:

IDENTIFY:: Define the requirements to be implemented according to the security policy.
PROTECT:: Implement and apply the requirements as an Ansible Playbook.
DETECT:: Monitor for drift and generate an audit report.
RESPOND:: Explore actions that could be taken when an incident is detected.
RECOVER:: Use Ansible to restore the systems to the known good configuration.
