# Fapolicyd

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG requires the fapolicyd daemon to be running. However, Ansible Automation Platform is not currently supported when fapolicyd enforcing policy, as this causes failures during the installation and operation of Ansible Automation Platform. Because of this, the installer runs a pre-flight check that will halt installation if it discovers that fapolicyd is enforcing policy. This guide recommends setting fapolicyd to permissive mode on the automation controller using the following steps:

1. Edit the file /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf and set "permissive = 1".
2. Restart the service with the command sudo systemctl restart fapolicyd.service.

In environments where STIG controls are routinely audited, discuss waiving the fapolicy-related STIG controls with your security auditor.


[NOTE]
----
If the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 STIG is also applied to the installation host, the default fapolicyd configuration causes the Ansible Automation Platform installer to fail. In this case, the recommendation is to set fapolicyd to permissive mode on the installation host.
