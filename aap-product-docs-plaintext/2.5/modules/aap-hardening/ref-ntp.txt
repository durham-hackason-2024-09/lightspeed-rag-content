# NTP

Configure each server in the Ansible Automation Platform infrastructure to synchronize time with an NTP pool or your organization&#8217;s NTP service. This ensures that logging and auditing events generated by Ansible Automation Platform have an accurate time stamp, and that any scheduled jobs running from the automation controller execute at the correct time.

For information on configuring the chrony service for NTP synchronization, see Using Chrony in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.
