# Initial configuration

Granting access to certain parts of the system exposes security vulnerabilities. Apply the following practices to help secure access:

* Minimize access to system administrative accounts. There is a difference between the user interface (web interface) and access to the operating system that the automation controller is running on. A system administrator or root user can access, edit, and disrupt any system application. Anyone with root access to the controller has the potential ability to decrypt those credentials, and so minimizing access to system administrative accounts is crucial for maintaining a secure system.
* Minimize local system access. Automation controller should not require local user access except for administrative purposes. Non-administrator users should not have access to the controller system.
* Enforce separation of duties. Different components of automation may need to access a system at different levels. Use different keys or credentials for each component so that the effect of any one key or credential vulnerability is minimized.
* Restrict automation controller to the minimum set of users possible for low-level controller configuration and disaster recovery only. In a controller context, any controller ‘system administrator’ or ‘superuser’ account can edit, change, and update any inventory or automation definition in the controller.
