# DNS and load balancing

When using a load balancer with Ansible Automation Platform as described in the reference architecture, an additional FQDN is needed for each load-balanced component (automation controller and private automation hub).

For example, if the following hosts are defined in the Ansible Automation Platform installer inventory file:


```
[automationcontroller]
controller0.example.com
controller1.example.com
controller2.example.com

[automationhub]
hub0.example.com
hub1.example.com
hub2.example.com
```


Then the load balancer can use the FQDNs controller.example.com and hub.example.com for the user-facing name of these Ansible Automation Platform services.

When a load balancer is used in front of the private automation hub, the installer must be aware of the load balancer FQDN. Before installing Ansible Automation Platform, in the installation inventory file set the automationhub_main_url variable to the FQDN of the load balancer. For example, to match the previous example, you would set the variable to automationhub_main_url = hub.example.com.
