# Ansible Automation Platform and additional software

When installing the Ansible Automation Platform components on Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers should be dedicated to that use alone. Additional server capabilities should not be installed in addition to Ansible Automation Platform, as this is an unsupported configuration and may affect the security and performance of the Ansible Automation Platform software.

Similarly, when Ansible Automation Platform is deployed on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host, it installs software like the nginx web server, the Pulp software repository, and the PostgreSQL database server. This software should not be modified or used in a more generic fashion (for example, do not use nginx to server additional website content or PostgreSQL to host additional databases) as this is an unsupported configuration and may affect the security and performance of Ansible Automation Platform. The configuration of this software is managed by the Ansible Automation Platform installer, and any manual changes might be undone when performing upgrades.
