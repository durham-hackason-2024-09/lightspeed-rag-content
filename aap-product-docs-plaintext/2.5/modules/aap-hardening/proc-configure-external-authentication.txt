# Configure an external authentication source

As noted in the User authentication planning section, external authentication is recommended for user access to the automation controller. After you choose the authentication type that best suits your needs, navigate to Settings and select Authentication in the automation controller UI, click on the relevant link for your authentication back-end, and follow the relevant instructions for configuring the authentication connection.

When using LDAP for external authentication with the automation controller, navigate to Settings and select Authentication and then select LDAP settings on the automation controller and ensure that one of the following is configured:

* For LDAP over SSL, the LDAP Server URI setting must begin with ldaps://` and use port 636, for example ldaps://ldap-server.example.com:636.
* For LDAP over TLS, the LDAP Start TLS setting must be set to "On".
