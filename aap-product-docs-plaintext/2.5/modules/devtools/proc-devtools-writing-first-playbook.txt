# Writing your first playbook

The instructions below describe how Ansible developer tools help you to create and run your first playbook in VS Code.

* You have installed and opened the Ansible VS Code extension.
* You have opened a terminal in VS Code.
* You have installed ansible-devtools.

1. Create a new .yml file in VS Code for your playbook, for example example_playbook.yml. Put it in the same directory level as the example site.yml file.
2. Add the following example code into the playbook file and save the file.
The playbook consists of a single play that executes a ping to your local machine.

```
- name: My first play
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Ping my hosts
      ansible.builtin.ping:
```


Ansible-lint runs in the background and displays errors in the Problems tab of the terminal.
There are no errors in this playbook:
![Ansible-lint showing no errors in a playbook]
3. Save your playbook file.
