# Setting up a directory for your playbooks

Create a directory to store your playbook projects.

You can add a directory using the file explorer in VS Code.

Alternatively, open a terminal, or click menu:Terminal[New Terminal] to open a terminal in VS Code. Run the following command:


```
$ mkdir my-playbooks
```


Add a .yml file to your playbook directory. You do not need to add content to the file yet.


```
$ cd test-playbooks
$ touch first-playbook.yml
```
