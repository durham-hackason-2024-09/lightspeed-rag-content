# Workflow

# Create

In the create  stage, you create a new playbook project locally, using VS Code. The following is a typical workflow:

1. Install and run the Ansible extension in VS Code.
2. Scaffold a playbook project from VS Code.
3. Add playbook files to your project and edit them in VS Code.

# Test

1. Debug your playbook with the help of ansible-lint.
2. Select or create an automation execution environment so that your local environment replicates the environment on Ansible Automation Platform.
3. Run your playbooks from VS Code, using ansible-playbook or using ansible-navigator with an execution environment.
4. Test your playbooks by running them on an execution environment that replicates your production environment.

# Deploy

1. Push your playbooks project to a source control repository.
2. Set up credentials on Ansible Automation Platform to pull from your source control repository and create a project for your playbook repository.
3. If you have created an execution environment, push it to private automation hub.
4. Create a job template on Ansible Automation Platform that runs a playbook from your project, and specify the execution environment that you want to use.
