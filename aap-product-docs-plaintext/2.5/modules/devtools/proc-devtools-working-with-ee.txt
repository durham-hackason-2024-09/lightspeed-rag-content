# Working with execution environments

You can view the automation execution environments provided by Red Hat in the
Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog.

Click on an execution environment for information on how to download it.

For example, to download the minimal RHEL 8 base image, run the following command:


```
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel9
```


You can build and create custom execution environments with ansible-builder.
For more information about working with execution environments locally, see
Creating and consuming execution environments.

After customizing your execution environment, you can push your new image to the container registry in automation hub. See
Publishing an automation execution environment
in the Creating and consuming execution environments documentation.
