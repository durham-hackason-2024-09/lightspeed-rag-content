# Setting up a VS Code workspace

A VS Code workspace is a project that consists of one or more directories that are opened simultaneously in a VS Code window.
The workspace stores project-level configurations, including settings and extension settings for the project.

1. Open your playbook directory in VS Code.
2. To create a workspace, select menu:File[Save Workspace As] and enter a name for your workspace.
3. Store the workspace file in your playbooks directory.

To open a workspace in VS Code, select menu:File[Open Workspace from File] and select your workspace file.
