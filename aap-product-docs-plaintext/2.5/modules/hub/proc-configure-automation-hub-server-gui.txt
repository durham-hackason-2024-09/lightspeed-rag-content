# Using the web console to configure Red Hat automation hub as the primary content source

To configure automation hub, you must create a credential and add it to the Organization’s Galaxy Credentials field. With automation hub, you have access to certified, supported collections.

* You have obtained the API token for the automation hub server. See Creating the Red Hat automation hub API token for more information.

2. Create a new credential.
1. Navigate to menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Credentials].
2. Click btn:[Add].
