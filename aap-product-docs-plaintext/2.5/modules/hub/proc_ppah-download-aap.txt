# Downloading Ansible Automation Platform

1. Download the latest installer tarball from access.redhat.com. This can be done directly within the RHEL host, which saves time.
2. If you have downloaded the tarball and optional manifest zip file onto your laptop, copy them onto your RHEL host.

Decide where you would like the installer to reside on the filesystem. Installation related files will be created under this location and require at least 10Gb for the initial installation.
3. Unpack the installer tarball into your installation directory, and cd into the unpacked directory.
1. online installer

```
$ tar xfvz ansible-automation-platform-partner-hub-setup-bundle-latest.tar.gz
```

2. bundled installer

```
$ tar xfvz ansible-automation-platform-partner-hub-setup-bundle-xxx-<arch name>.tar.gz
```


Ansible collections will already be installed inside the directory called collections. You will have to set ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH environment variable to the directory path to consume the ansible collections.
4. Set ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH:


```
$ export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/path/to/ansible-automation-platform-partner-hub-setup-bundle-xxx/collections
```
