# Container registries

The automation hub container registry is used for storing and managing container images.
When you have built or sourced a container image, you can push that container image to the registry portion of private automation hub to create a container repository.

* Push a container image to the automation hub container registry.
* Create a group with access to the container repository in the registry.
* Add the new group to the container repository.
* Add a README to the container repository to provide users with information and relevant links.
