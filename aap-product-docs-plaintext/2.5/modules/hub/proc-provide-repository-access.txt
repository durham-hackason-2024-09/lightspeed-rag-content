2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Locate your repository in the list and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then select Edit.
4. Select the Access tab.
5. Select a group for Repository owners.

See Configuring user access for your private automation hub for information about implementing user access.

7. Click btn:[Save].
