# Revert to a different automation hub repository version

When automation content collections are added or removed from a repository, a new version is created. If a change to your repository causes a problem, you can revert to a previous version. Reverting is a safe operation and does not delete collections from the system, but rather, changes the content associated with the repository. The number of versions saved is defined in the Retained number of versions setting when a repository is created.

1. Log in to private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
3. Locate your repository in the list and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then select Edit.
4. Locate the version you want to revert to and click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, and select Revert to this version.
5. Click btn:[Revert].
