# Syncing images from a container repository

You can pull images from the automation hub container registry to sync an image to your local machine.
To sync an image from a remote container registry, you must first configure a remote registry.

You must have permission to view and pull from a private container repository.

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
2. Add https://registry.redhat.io to the registry.
3. Add any required credentials to authenticate.

[NOTE]
----
Some container registries are aggressive with rate limiting.
Set a rate limit under Advanced Options.
----
4. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Execution Environments].
5. Click btn:[Add execution environment] in the page header.
6. Select the registry you want to pull from.
The Name field displays the name of the image displayed on your local registry.

[NOTE]
----
The Upstream name field is the name of the image on the remote server.
For example, if the upstream name is set to "alpine" and the Name field is "local/alpine", the alpine image is downloaded from the remote and renamed to "local/alpine".
----
7. Set a list of tags to include or exclude.
Syncing images with a large number of tags is time consuming and uses a lot of disk space.

* See Red Hat Container Registry Authentication for a list of registries.
* See the What is Podman? documentation for options to use when pulling images.
