# Setting up the shared filesystem

You must mount the shared file system on each automation hub node:

1. Create the /var/lib/pulp directory.

```
# mkdir /var/lib/pulp
```

2. Mount the shared filesystem (this reference environment uses an NFS share).

```
# mount -t nfs4 <nfs_share_ip_address>:/ /var/lib/pulp
```

3. Confirm that the shared filesystem is successfully mounted:

```
$ df -h
```
