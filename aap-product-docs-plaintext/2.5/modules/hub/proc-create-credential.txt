# Creating a credential in automation controller

To pull container images from a password or token-protected registry, you must create a credential in automation controller.

In earlier versions of Ansible Automation Platform, you were required to deploy a registry to store execution environment images.
On Ansible Automation Platform 2.0 and later, the system operates as if you already have a container registry up and running.
To store execution environment images, add the credentials of only your selected container registries.

1. Navigate to automation controller.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Execution[Infrastructure > Credentials].
3. Click btn:[Add] to create a new credential.
4. Enter an authorization Name, Description, and Organization.
5. Select the Credential Type.
6. Enter the Authentication URL. This is the container registry address.
7. Enter the Username and Password or Token required to log in to the container registry.
8. Optional: To enable SSL verification, select Verify SSL.
9. Click btn:[Save].

Filling in at least one of the fields organization, user, or team is mandatory, and can be done through the user interface
