# Pushing a container image to private automation hub

You can push tagged container images to private automation hub to create new containers and populate the container registry.

* You have permissions to create new containers.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

1. Log in to Podman using your automation hub location and credentials:

```
$ podman login -u=<username> -p=<password> <automation_hub_url>
```


[WARNING]
----
Let Podman prompt you for your password when you log in. Entering your password at the same time as your username can expose your password to the shell history.
----
2. Push your container image to your automation hub container registry:

```
$ podman push <automation_hub_url>/<container_image_name>
```


The push operation re-compresses image layers during the upload, which is not guaranteed to be reproducible and is client-implementation dependent.
This may lead to image-layer digest changes and a failed push operation, resulting in Error: Copying this image requires changing layer representation, which is not possible (image is signed or the destination specifies a digest).

1. Log in to your automation hub.
2. Navigate to menu:Container Registry[].
3. Locate the container in the container repository list.
