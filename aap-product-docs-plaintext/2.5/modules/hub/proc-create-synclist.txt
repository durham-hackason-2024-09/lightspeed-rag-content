# Creating a synclist of Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections

You can create a synclist of curated Red Hat Ansible Certified Content in Ansible automation hub on console.redhat.com.
Your synclist repository is located on the automation hub navigation panel under menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories], which is updated whenever you manage content within Ansible Certified Content Collections.

All Ansible Certified Content Collections are included by default in your initial organization synclist.

* You have a valid Ansible Automation Platform subscription.
* You have Organization Administrator permissions for console.redhat.com.
* The following domain names are part of either the firewall or the proxy's allowlist.
They are required for successful connection and download of collections from automation hub or Galaxy server:
* galaxy.ansible.com
* cloud.redhat.com
* console.redhat.com
* sso.redhat.com
* Ansible automation hub resources are stored in Amazon Simple Storage.
The following domain names must be in the allow list:
* automation-hub-prd.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
* ansible-galaxy.s3.amazonaws.com
* SSL inspection is disabled either when using self signed certificates or for the Red Hat domains.

1. Log in to console.redhat.com.
2. Navigate to menu:Automation Hub[Collections].
3. Set the toggle switch on each collection to exclude or include it on your synclist.
4. To initiate the remote repository synchronization, navigate to automation hub and select menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories].
5. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942; and select Sync to initiate the remote repository synchronization to your private automation hub.
6. Optional: If your remote repository is already configured, update the collections content that you made available to local users by manually synchronizing Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections to your private automation hub.
