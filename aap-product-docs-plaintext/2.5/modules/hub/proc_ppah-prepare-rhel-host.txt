# Preparing the RHEL host for containerized installation

Containerized Ansible Automation Platform runs the component services as podman-based containers on top of a RHEL host. The installer takes care of this once the underlying host has been prepared. Use the following instructions to prepare the host.

1. Log into your RHEL host as your non-root user.
2. Run dnf repolist to validate only the BaseOS and appstream repos are setup and enabled on the host:

```
$ dnf repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
repo id                                                    repo name
rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                           Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                              Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
```

3. Ensure that these repos and only these repos are available to the host OS. If you need to know how to do this use this guide:
Chapter 10. Managing custom software repositories Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4. Ensure that the host has DNS configured and can resolve hostnames and IPs using a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). This is essential to ensure services can talk to one another.

To configure unbound DNS refer to Chapter 2. Setting up an unbound DNS server Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

To configure DNS using BIND refer to Chapter 1. Setting up and configuring a BIND DNS server Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.
