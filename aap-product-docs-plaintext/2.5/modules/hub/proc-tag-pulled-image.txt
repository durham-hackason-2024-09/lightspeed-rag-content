# Tagging images for use in automation hub

After you pull images from a registry, tag them for use in your private automation hub container registry.

* You have pulled a container image from an external registry.
* You have the FQDN or IP address of the automation hub instance.

* Tag a local image with the automation hub container repository:

```
$ podman tag registry.redhat.io/<container_image_name>:<tag> <automation_hub_hostname>/<container_image_name>
```


1. List the images in local storage:

```
$ podman images
```

2. Verify that the image you recently tagged with your automation hub information is contained in the list.
