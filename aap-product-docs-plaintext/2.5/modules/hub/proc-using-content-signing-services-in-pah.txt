# Using content signing services in private automation hub

After you have configured content signing on your private automation hub, you can manually sign a new collection or replace an existing signature with a new one.
When users download a specific collection, this signature indicates that the collection is for them and has not been modified after certification.

You can use content signing on private automation hub in the following scenarios:

* Your system does not have automatic signing configured and you must use a manual signing process to sign collections.
* The current signatures on the automatically configured collections are corrupted and need new signatures.
* You need additional signatures for previously signed content.
* You want to rotate signatures on your collections.

1. Log in to your Ansible Automation Platform.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Collection Approvals].
The Approval dashboard opens and displays a list of collections.
3. Click btn:[Sign and approve] for each collection that you want to sign.

* Verify that the collections you signed and manually approved are displayed in the Collections tab.
