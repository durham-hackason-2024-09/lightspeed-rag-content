# Deleting a namespace

You can delete unwanted namespaces to manage storage on your automation hub server.
You must first ensure that the namespace does not contain a collection with dependencies.

* The namespace you are deleting does not have a collection with dependencies.
* You have Delete namespace permissions.

1. Log in to your private automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces].
3. Click the namespace to be deleted.
4. Click the btn:[More Actions] icon &#8942;, then click btn:[Delete namespace].

[NOTE]
----
If the btn:[Delete namespace] button is disabled, the namespace contains a collection with dependencies. Review the collections in this namespace, and delete any dependencies. See Deleting a collection on automation hub for information.
----

The namespace that you deleted, as well as its associated collections, is now deleted and removed from the namespace list view.
