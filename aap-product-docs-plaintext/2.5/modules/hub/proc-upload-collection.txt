# Uploading a collection to automation hub

If you want to share a collection that you have created with the rest of the Ansible community, you can upload it to automation hub. When you upload a collection to automation hub, our Partner Engineering team reviews it for certification.

You can upload the collection by using either the automation hub user interface or the ansible-galaxy client.

* You have configured the ansible-galaxy client for Red Hat Automation Hub.
* You have at least one namespace.
* You have run all content through ansible-test sanity.
* You are a Red Hat Connect Partner. Learn more at Red Hat Partner Connect.

Using the automation hub user interface:

1. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces].
2. On the My namespaces tab, locate the namespace to which you want to upload a collection.
3. Click View collections and click btn:[Upload collection].
4. In the New collection modal, click btn:[Select file]. Locate the file on your system.
5. Click btn:[Upload].

Using the ansible-galaxy client:

* Enter the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection publish path/to/my_namespace-my_collection-1.0.0.tar.gz --api-key=SECRET
```


* After you upload your collections, they enter the partner certification process. Our Partner Engineering team will contact you with the certification status of your collection.
