# Importing an automation content collection in automation hub

As an automation content creator, you can import a collection to use in a custom repository. To use a collection in your custom repository, you must first import the collection into your namespace so the automation hub administrator can approve it.

1. Log in to automation hub.
2. From the navigation panel, select menu:Automation Content[Namespaces]. The Namespaces page displays all of the namespaces available.
3. Click btn:[View Collections].
4. Click btn:[Upload Collection].
5. Navigate to the collection tarball file, select the file and click btn:[Open].
6. Click btn:[Upload].

The My Imports screen displays a summary of tests and notifies you if the collection upload is successful or has failed.

[NOTE]
----
If the collection is not approved, it is not displayed in the published repository.
