# Installing a production automation hub

Use the playbook install_prod to install a production-ready, highly available automation hub. This option requires the user to manage all supporting services.

* External PostgreSQL server
* LDAP server
* NFS server

The playbook requires the following parameters. For more detail, refer to the production-sample-values template in the tarball.

* PostgreSQL
* LDAP: hub_authentication_backend must be set to ldap
* NFS

1. Run the installation playbook using the following command:


```
ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory> -e @</path/to/values> ansible.private_partner_automation_hub_installer.install_prod
```



[NOTE]
----
The production option mandates a three-node installation, and installs automation hub on all hosts, so there is no need to assign the nodes to a group in the inventory file.
