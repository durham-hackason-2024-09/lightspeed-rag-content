# Configuring Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify collections

You can configure Ansible-Galaxy CLI to verify collections.
This ensures that downloaded collections are approved by your organization and have not been changed after they were uploaded to automation hub.

If a collection has been signed by automation hub, the server provides ASCII armored, GPG-detached signatures to verify the authenticity of MANIFEST.json before using it to verify the collectionâ€™s contents.
You must opt into signature verification by configuring a keyring for ansible-galaxy or providing the path with the --keyring option.

* Signed collections are available in automation hub to verify signature.
* Certified collections can be signed by approved roles within your organization.
* Public key for verification has been added to the local system keyring.

1. To import a public key into a non-default keyring for use with ansible-galaxy, run the following command.

```
gpg --import --no-default-keyring --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx my-public-key.asc
```


[NOTE]
----
In addition to any signatures provided by the automation hub, signature sources can also be provided in the requirements file and on the command line.
Signature sources should be URIs.
----
2. To verify the collection name provided on the CLI with an additional signature, run the following command:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install namespace.collection
--signature https://examplehost.com/detached_signature.asc
--signature file:///path/to/local/detached_signature.asc --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx
```


You can use this option multiple times to provide multiple signatures.
3. Confirm that the collections in a requirements file list any additional signature sources following the collection's signatures key, as in the following example.

```yaml
# requirements.yml
collections:
  - name: ns.coll
    version: 1.0.0
    signatures:
      - https://examplehost.com/detached_signature.asc
      - file:///path/to/local/detached_signature.asc

ansible-galaxy collection verify -r requirements.yml --keyring ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx
```


When you install a collection from automation hub, the signatures provided by the server are saved along with the installed collections to verify the collection&#8217;s authenticity.
4. (Optional) If you need to verify the internal consistency of your collection again without querying the Ansible Galaxy server, run the same command you used previously using the --offline option.

## Are there any recommendations for collection naming?

Create a collection with company_name.product format.
This format means that multiple products can have different collections under the company namespace.

## How do I get a namespace on Ansible automation hub?

By default namespaces used on Ansible Galaxy are also used on Ansible automation hub by the Ansible partner team.
