# Using the CLI to configure Red Hat automation hub as the primary content source

To configure automation hub, you must update the ansible.cfg configuration file. By default, the ansible.cfg configuration file is located in the /etc/ansible/ directory. With automation hub, you have access to certified, supported collections.

* You have obtained the API token for the automation hub server. See Creating the Red Hat automation hub API token for more information.


[IMPORTANT]
----
Creating a new token revokes any previous tokens generated for automation hub. Update any automation controller or scripts created with the previous token to include the new token.
----

1. Open the ansible.cfg file.
2. Add the server_list option under the [galaxy] section and include one or more server names.
3. Create a new section for each server name:

```
[galaxy_server._<server_name>_]
```

4. Set the url option for each server name:

```
https://<server_fully_qualified_domain_name>/api/galaxy/
```

5. Optional: Set the auth_url option. The community Ansible Galaxy does not require an auth_url.
6. Set the API token for the automation hub server.

The following ansible.cfg configuration file example shows how to configure multiple servers in prioritized order. Automation hub is configured as your primary source and an Ansible Galaxy server as a secondary source:


```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub, my_org_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/published/ 1
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token

token=my_ah_token

[galaxy_server.my_org_hub]
url=https://automation.my_org/api/galaxy/content/rh-certified/ 2
username=my_user
password=my_pass
```


Include a trailing slash / after the server URL.
Include the /api/galaxy/content/rh-certified/ subdirectory in the automation hub server URL. You can replace rh-certified with community to reference the community repository if you prefer.


[NOTE]
----
To prevent a 301 redirect, all API URLs must end with a trailing slash /.
----

You have now configured automation hub as your primary server. You can begin to download and install supported collections.
