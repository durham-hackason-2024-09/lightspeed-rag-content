# Configuring the community remote repository and syncing Ansible Galaxy collections

You can edit the community remote repository to synchronize chosen collections from Ansible Galaxy to your private automation hub.
By default, your private automation hub community repository directs to galaxy.ansible.com/api/.

* You have Modify Ansible repo content permissions.
For more information on permissions, see Configuring user access for your private automation hub.
* You have a requirements.yml file that identifies those collections to synchronize from Ansible Galaxy as in the following example:
Requirements.yml example

```
collections:
  # Install a collection from Ansible Galaxy.
  - name: community.aws
    version: 5.2.0
    source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
```
