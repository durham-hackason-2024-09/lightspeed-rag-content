# Explanation of Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Collections synclists

A synclist is a curated group of Red Hat Certified Collections that is assembled by your organization administrator.
It synchronizes with your local Ansible automation hub.
Use synclists to manage only the content that you want and exclude unnecessary collections.
Design and manage your synclist from the content available as part of Red Hat content on console.redhat.com

Each synclist has its own unique repository URL that you can use to designate as a remote source for content in automation hub.
You securely access each synclist by using an API token.
