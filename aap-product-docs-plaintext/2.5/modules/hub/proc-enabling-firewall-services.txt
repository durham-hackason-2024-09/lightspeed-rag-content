# Enabling firewall services

Because of the requirement of using a shared filesystem as part of a highly available Ansible automation hub environment, the following firewall services must be enabled to ensure that the filesystem is successfully mounted.

On each Ansible automation hub node, you must:

1. Ensure the following firewalld services (nfs, mountd, rpc-bind) are enabled.

```
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=nfs
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=mountd
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=rpc-bind
```

2. Reload firewalld for changes to take effect.

```
# firewall-cmd --reload
```

3. Verify the firewalld services are enabled.

```
# firewall-cmd --get-services
```
