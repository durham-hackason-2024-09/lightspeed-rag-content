# Assigning roles to groups

You can assign roles to groups, giving users access to specific features in the system, from both the Groups menu and the Namespaces menu. Roles assigned to a group from the Groups menu have a global scope. For example, if a user is assigned a namespace owner role, that permission applies to all namespaces. However, roles assigned to a group from the Namespaces menu will only give a user access to a specific instance of an object.

* You are signed in as a hubadmin user.
