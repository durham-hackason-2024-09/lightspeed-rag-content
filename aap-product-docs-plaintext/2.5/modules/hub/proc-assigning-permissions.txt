# Assigning permissions to groups

By default, new groups do not have any assigned permissions.
You can assign permissions to groups in private automation hub that enable users to access specific features in the system.

You can add permissions when first creating a group or edit an existing group to add or remove permissions

For more information, see Assigning permissions to groups in the Getting started with automation hub guide.
