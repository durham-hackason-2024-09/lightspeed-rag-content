# Reasons to create remote configurations

Each remote configuration located in menu:Automation Content[Remotes] provides information for both the community and rh-certified repository about when the repository was last updated.
You can add new content to Ansible automation hub at any time using the Edit and Sync features included on the menu:MenuTopAC[Repositories] page.
